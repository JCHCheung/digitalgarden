# Parkinson's disease
The pathophysiology of PD is a loss of dopaminergic neurones in the pars compacta region of the substantia nigra, leading to the classical motor symptoms of parkinsonism: 
- bradykinesia,
- muscle rigidity,
- asymmetric resting tremor

it is a multi-system neurological disorder which causes disabling ==motor==, ==neuropsychiatric==, and ==autonomic== dysfunction

## Withdrawal
parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome (PHS), due to withdrawal of levodopa. Symptoms mimic those of neuroleptic malignant syndrome:
- muscle rigidity,
- fever,
- cardiovascular instability,
- altered mental status
	- (agitation, delirium, coma)
PHS carries a significant mortality, up to 20% in untreated cases.

dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome (DAWS). Symptoms include: 
- anxiety,
- nausea,
- depression,
- pain,
- orthostatic hypotension
Withdrawal of dopamine agonists should be planned electively and simultaneously replaced with levodopa-DDI regimes.

## Peri-op drug Mx
The guiding principle of the perioperative pharmacological management of PD patients is to maintain CNS dopamine receptor activation. In most cases, this can be achieved by continuing the patient's usual anti-parkinsonian drug regime into the perioperative period: allowing patients to take their drugs up until anaesthetic induction, that is, within the ‘nil-by-mouth’ period with a sip of water, utilizing anaesthetic techniques which enable a rapid return to oral intake, for example, central neuraxial block, or by administering drugs enterally via a nasogastric tube (NB for dispersible preparations only—due to the differing bioavailabilities, a 30% dose reduction is suggested if the patient usually takes modified-release preparation). PD patients should usually be placed first on the operating list, so that the timing of drug administration is predictable, the risk of cancellation is minimized, and to ensure optimal early postoperative disease management.

## Monitoring
A significant tremor may induce monitoring artifacts: the ECG trace may mimic atrial flutter or ventricular fibrillation, and it may be difficult to measure arterial pressure non-invasively. 
Excessive sweating due to autonomic dysfunction may result in poor ECG electrode contact.
## Induction of anaesthesia. 
Just as in the general population, propofol may cause dyskinetic movements in PD patients. But propofol is also an anti-emetic and temporarily suppresses the parkinsonian resting tremor, and is therefore probably the best choice of induction agent in most situations. 
Thiopental and [[Knowledge/Medicine/Ketamine\|ketamine]] have been used in PD patients without harm, despite theoretical risks of exacerbation of parkinsonian symptoms and exaggerated sympathetic response, respectively.
With the exception of ==halothane==, which potentiates levodopa-induced arrhythmias, the volatile anaesthetic agents are safe. Whichever drug is used for induction of anaesthesia, it is important that it is used judiciously: perioperative hypotension can be difficult to manage, and is especially common in the presence of ==autonomic dysfunction or dehydration==.
## Neuromuscular block
[[Knowledge/Medicine/neuromuscular blocking agent\|NMBA]] in general safe
But ==residual block== in the immediate postoperative period can mask parkinsonian symptoms, and [[neostigmine\|neostigmine]] should be used with caution due to its ==thickening== action on airway ==secretions==. Perhaps, the ideal agent is [[rocuronium\|rocuronium]], as it may be reversed by [[sugammadex\|sugammadex]].
## Opioids
if on MAOI → should not use [[pethidine\|pethidine]] ∵ risk of [[pages/Serotonin syndrome\|Serotonin syndrome]]
high dose strong opioid bolus may lead to rigidity
## Pharmacological
Contraindicated
- dopamine antagonist exacerbate PD symptoms
	- phenothiazines
		- prochlorperazine
	- butyrophenones
		- droperidol
	- benzamides
		- metoclopramide
	- typical anti-psychotics
		- haloperidol
Caution
- centrally acting anticholinergics e.g. [[atropine\|atropine]]
	-  may ppt central anticholinergic syndrome
		- confusion
		- somnolence
		- restlesness
	- [[glycopyrrolate\|glycopyrrolate]] safe alternative
- [[halothane\|halothane]]
	- sensitise the heart to catecholamines
		- may potentiate levodopa-induced arrhythmias
- [[pethidine\|pethidine]]
	- CI if on MAOI
- direct-acting sympathomimetics (if on MAOI)
## Airway
Sialorrhoea can complicate airway management, and may be reduced with glycopyrrolate. Intubation should be considered if dysphagia is suspected. There is an increased prevalence of gastroparesis and gastrooesophageal reflux disease in PD patients, which may necessitate rapid sequence induction. Laryngoscopy may be difficult in the presence of a fixed flexion deformity of the neck.
## Anti-emetics
A number of commonly used anti-emetics are contraindicated in PD, due to dopamine antagonist effects. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, for example, [[ondansetron\|ondansetron]], and histamine H1-receptor antagonists, for example, [[cyclizine\|cyclizine]], have fewer side-effects. Despite being a dopamine receptor antagonist, [[domperidone\|domperidone]] does not readily cross the BBB and so is safe to use in PD.
## Surgical diathermy
PD patients with an implanted [[Knowledge/Part 2/NS/Deep brain stimulation\|DBS]] will occasionally present for surgery. Surgical diathermy is not contraindicated, but can damage the DBS leads, or can cause suppression or reprogramming of the neurostimulator.
If surgical diathermy is necessary, the neurostimulator device should be switched off immediately before induction of anaesthesia, and bipolar diathermy should be used. Post-operatively, the neurostimulator should be checked to confirm normal function.

# Post-op
PONV
delirium
- avoid typical anti-psychotics
analgesic plan
enteral route may be unreliable
resume anti-PD drug
