# Pulmonary embolism


## ECG
- **Sinus Tachycardia**
    - Don’t need tachycardia to have a PE. Seen in only ~30% of patients, but signals increased oxygen demand
- **Atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias**
    - SVT, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, etc.
    - SVTs (AVNRT, AVRT, atrial and junctional tachycardias, etc.) have been shown to be an independent predictor of subsequent clinical deterioration
- **ECG Signs of RV strain**
    - Rightward axis (look for large S wave in lead I)
        - S1Q3 or S1Q3T3
	        - (==McGinn White== pattern)
	        - not sensitive or specific
		        - unless ==large S wave==
    - Conduction delays and repolarization abnormalities
        - New RBBB or incomplete RBBB
        - Look for tall R waves in V1
    - New T-wave inversions
        - Right precordial leads (V1-V4)
        - Inferior leads (II, III, aVF)
        - New T wave inversions in the anteroseptal leads +/- inferior leads should be considered a sign of acute pulmonary hypertension or PE until proven otherwise
    - ST-segment elevations or depressions (mimics ischemia)
    - ST-segment elevation in rightward leads (V1, V2, aVR, III)

Co, et al. _J Emerg Med_ 2017 (PMID: [27742402](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27742402/)) – identified the most common ECG changes in patients with known PE when comparing their ECGs with previous ECGs
- 285 PEs diagnosed on CTA (62% segmental, 20% in main pulmonary artery, 8% saddle)
	- **No ECG changes ~ 24%**
	- **TWI ~ 34%**
		- sensitive V1-V3
		- specific: also III, aVF
	- T wave flattening ~ 30%
	- **Sinus tachycardia ~ 27%**
	- Rightward axis ~ 11%
	- ST segment changes ~ 9%
	- **S1Q3T3 ~ 4%**

### ECG findings a/w hemodynamic instability & ↑ morbidity + mortality:
- TWIs in right precordial leads
- ST-segment elevation and depression
    - Especially STE in V1-V2, aVR, III
- Signs of right heart strain (right axis deviation, tall R wave in V1)
- Tachycardia 
	- (sinus, afib/flutter)
