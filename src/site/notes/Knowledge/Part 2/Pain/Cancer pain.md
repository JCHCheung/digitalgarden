# Cancer pain

### Risk factor:
- smoking
- insomnia
- malignancy type:
	- leukaemia
	- lymphoma
	- lung
	- breast
	- colorectal 
- Age <65
## Cause of pain in cancer patients:
### Tumour related
- local mass effect
- cancer-induced bone pain
	- ==neuropathic + inflammatory== pain
	- either 1° bone malignancy or 2° bone met
	- normal bone homeostasis disrupted ∵ ↑ osteoclast activity from ↑RANK ligand
	- formation of abnormal ==periosteal microneuroma==
		- stimulated by nerve growth factor
		- → further sensitised by inflammatory mediators
- [[paraneoplastic\|paraneoplastic]] effects
- central sensitisation
	- nociceptors sensitised by various inflammatory mediators e.g.
		- ATP
		- cytokines
		- endothelin
		- neurotrophic factors
	- ↑ excitability at transcriptional or post-translational level
	- ↓ firing threshold
### Treatment related
#### Surgical
- [[Knowledge/Part 2/Pain/chronic post-surgical pain\|CPSP]]
#### [[chemotherapy\|chemotherapy]]
ADR from chemo → ==psychological== morbidity → worsen pain state
##### Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN)
- multifactorial
	- mitochondrial toxicity
	- proteosome inhibition
	- anti-angiogenesis
	- microtubule disruption
- ==length dependent sensory neuropathy==
	- typically ==glove & stocking== distribution
	- some fine motor & balance effects ∵ abnormal proprioception
- both loss of function + gain of function symptoms
- risk factors
	- pre-existing neuropathy
	- smoking
	- renal failure
	- [[DM\|DM]]
- chemo agents
	- vincristine
	- platinum compounds
	- taxanes
		- paclitaxel
		- docetaxel
#### [[pages/Radiotherapy\|RT]]
- tissue damage from
	- direct cell injury from ionising radiation
	- inflammation
	- oxidative stress
	- triggering innate immune response
- alter gene expression → release proinflammatory cytokines
- proinflammatory state → ==fibrosis==
	- acute radiation fibrosis syndrome
		- w/i days to wks of treatment
	- chronic radiation fibrosis syndrome
		- months to years after treatment
- radiation induced ==peripheral neuropathy==
	- progressive & ==irreversible==
	- can present ==years after treatment cessation==
	- ∵ direct axonal injury, demyelination, injury to vasculature → ischaemia
		- together w/ fibrosis → chronic peripheral neuropathy

inhibit aromatase which converts androgens into oestrogens
Aromatase inhibitor-associated ==arthralgia==
- polyarthralgia
- affecting mainly the wrists, hands and knees
- affects around 50% of those taking AIs
- may have an impact on treatment compliance in 20% of those affected
- potential aetiology
	- oestrogen depletion
	- cytokine release
	- [[Vitamin D deficiency\|Vitamin D deficiency]]

	- arthralgia
	- inflammatory myositis
	- systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)/Sicca syndrome
	- sarcoidosis
	- vasculitis with associated neuropathy
	- intensity can be severe, requiring the of cessation of treatment and initiation of immunosuppression

## Management
Non-pharmacological adjuncts:
- massage
- physiotherapy
- hypnotherapy
- music therapy
[[Prehabilitation\|Prehabilitation]] is the process of optimising physical and psychological health before an invasive treatment such as major surgery. It has been demonstrated to decrease postoperative pain and increase functional levels.
### Pharmacological

#### WHO pain ladder
- Since 1986
- most effective at acute nociceptive cancer pain.
	- may not represent the optimal approach in all patients
		- ∵ changing nature of cancer pain from ==acute → chronic==
- based around opioid escalation
	- both strength & dose
- not written specifically for ==neuropathic pain==
	- Antineuropathic agents recommended in the updated WHO guidelines
		- but as adjunctive therapies
		- limited guidance on how or when they should be used
	- not include [[gabapentinoid\|gabapentinoid]] & [[SNRI\|SNRI]]
		- both have a role in treatment of neuropathic pain
- → starting point for non-specialist
### Topical agents
- most commonly used for CIPN
- Menthol cream
	- acts on the transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8)
		- upregulated in neuropathic pain
- [[pages/local anaesthetics\|LA]] topically either via patches or cream (EMLA/AMETOP)
	- RCT evidence supporting use is limited
	- shown to be effective in individual studies
- Capsaicin
	- agonist of TRPV1
	- depletes neuronal substance P
		- → desensitises TRPV1 receptors → analgesia
- Doxepin
	- [[pages/tricyclic antidepressant\|TCA]]
### [[pages/opioid\|Opioid]]
- particularly effective for ==acute nociceptive pain==
- less appropriate for ==chronic== pain 
	- ∵ ADR
		- potential for addiction
		- [[pages/opioid#OIH\|opioid induced hyperalgesia]]
- worsening cancer survival outcomes
	- limited evidence & controversial
	- ? ∵ immunological & proangiogenic properties of opioids
	- interaction w/ ==TLR4== receptors
	- → can be used safely when monitored appropriately
- concerns around opioids weighed against potential ==pro-oncogenic== properties of pain itself
	- ∵ ==adrenergic== effects on cancer cells
### [[NSAID\|NSAID]]
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective non-opioid drugs for a variety of acute and chronic pain syndromes
### Antineuropathic agents

==WHO==: no recommendation for or against ANY agents
==Cochrane== review: duloxetine supported by most robust evidence

==IASP== NeupSIG recommendations for the management of neuropathic pain in adults.

### Cannabinoids
- animal model studies demonstrating benefit of cannabinoids in CIPN
- ==inconclusive== benefit from recent meta-analysis
- ∵ ==immunomodulatory== effects of cannabinoids
	- → some evidence of negative survival outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy
### Botox
- increasingly used in ==chronic== pain
- dual mechanism of action
	- At [[NMJ\|NMJ]] prevent the release of [[acetylcholine\|acetylcholine]] 
		- useful in pain of ==MSK== origin
	- action on ==sensory nerves==
		- inhibits the release of neurotransmitters & inflammatory agents
			- ∴ useful in localised ==neuropathic== pain
### Intervention: neuromodulation
Neuromodulation is the process by which nerve function can be altered by the ==direct application== of ==electricity or biochemicals== to neurones
#### Acupuncture
- mediating the release of opioid peptides, serotonin & other local & systemic signalling molecules
- acupuncture plus drug therapy more effective than conventional drug therapy alone for cancer-related pain
- its use in an integrated fashion in cancer pain is recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology
#### Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
- noninvasive neuromodulation technique
- placing small skin electrodes over peripheral nerves or the spinal cord
- evidence controversial
- favourable risk–benefit profile & low cost
	- → should be considered as part of multimodal analgesic strategy.
#### Peripheral nerve stimulation
- if pain limited to discrete locations or dermatomes specific nerves
	- can be targeted using stimulators implanted percutaneously
- may be used in CIPN
#### Spinal cord stimulation
- Pain signals modulated centrally
	- deep brain stimulation (DBS)
	- spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
- placing electrodes into the epidural space either percutaneously or surgically
- ==gate control theory== of pain
	- stimulation of ==A-β== fibres prevents transmission of nociceptive input from ==A-δ and C== fibres
#### Intrathecal drug delivery
- Principle
	- Systemic opioids deliver most of ==therapeutic== effect via ==central μ== opioid receptors
	- ADR predominantly mediated by ==peripheral receptors==
		- little or no benefit of analgesia
- ↓↓ doses of drug can be introduced directly to the site of action
	- oral : intrathecal = ==300 : 1==
	- ↑↑ analgesia whilst ↓↓ adverse effects
- single shot (e.g. as adjunct to acute pain from surgery) vs intrathecal ==catheter==
- externalised vs implanted ==pump== for longer term use
- For drug only for ==intrathecal route==
	- ziconotide
		- derived from cone snail toxin
		- N-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker
		- must be delivered intrathecally
#### Neuroablative procedure
- e.g.
	- nerve blocks
	- thalamotomy
	- cordotomy
- predominantly deployed in the ==terminal phase== of cancer
	- where the balance of risks and benefits is altered
	- potential adverse effects more acceptable
