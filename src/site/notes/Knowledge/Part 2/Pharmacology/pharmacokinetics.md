## Changes in sepsis / critical illness
![](https://i.imgur.com/xUtZyY1.png)
### Δ in absorption
effect on GI tract
- ↓ intestinal peristalsis
- mucosal impairment
- altered drug metabolism
Enteric drug absorption and availability are difficult to predict, mainly due to 
- fluctuations in gastric pH,
- loss of enteric architecture,
- ↓ enzymatic activity
delay in gastric emptying extends the time needed to achieve maximum concentrations of the antibiotic
### Vd
↑Vd → ↓Cmax & total drug concentration over time
→ risks of ==underdosing== / subtherapeutic conc.
→ may need ==↑ loading dose==

As the Vd of antibiotics is often increased, higher loading doses are needed for hydrophilic antimicrobials (e.g., β-lactams, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and colistin) to achieve similar and adequate therapeutic concentrations

#### ↑Vd ∵ ==Δcompartment volume==
- ↑ vascular ==permeability==
	- ↑ interstitial space compartment vol
- administration of ==fluids==
- presence of pleural effusion / ascites / surgical drains
→ ==Hydrophilic== drugs more susceptible
- ß lactam
- aminoglycosides
- vancomycin
#### ↑Vd ∵ ==Hypoalbuminaemia==
↓[[Albumin\|Albumin]] → ↑ fraction of unbound drug → ↑Vd
drug w/ ==high plasma protein binding== more susceptible
- ceftriaxone
- cefazolin
- ertapenem
- echinocandins
- teicoplanin
### Δ drug clearance
clearance = determinant of ==maintenance dose==

↓ organ perfusion → organ dysfunction
- ↓ hepatic blood flow ↓ drug metabolism
	- esp drugs w/ ↑hepatic metabolism + high ==extraction ratio==
##### Augmented renal clearance
In clinical practice, a measured urinary creatinine clearance (CrCl) value of ==≥130== mL⋅min-1⋅1.73 m-2 is most commonly used as the cut-off value for defining ARC
- ==hyperdynamic== haemodynamic states ↑ organ blood flow
	- a/w conditions e.g.
		- SIRS
		- trauma
		- burns
		- pregnancy
- renal function ==reserve==
	- ability to ↑GFR
		- nephron recruitment
		- ↑ renal blood flow
		- → ↑ hyperfiltration
- brain-kidney crosstalk in ==neuro== patients
	- ? ∵ autonomic dysfunction affecting organ perfusion
- Risk factors
	- young age
	- sepsis
	- trauma / burns
	- surgery / neurosurgery
	- febrile neutropenia
affecting ==hydrophilic== drugs primarily ==cleared via kidney==

usually develops early
duration of ARC varied widely, with a median and maximum time frame of 5 days and more than 1 month

The Cockroft-Gault, Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, and Modification of Diet in Renal disease equations have been shown to ==underestimate== renal function in critically ill patients. It is therefore essential to evaluate the measured CrCl on a daily basis to better identify ARC in patients receiving hydrophilic antibiotics (e.g., β-lactams, vancomycin, or aminoglycosides)

#### RRT
changes to the PK depend on 
- specific characteristics of the ==extracorporeal== circuit
	- membrane permeability, 
	- intensity of therapy, 
- ==physicochemical properties== of the drug
	- molecular size, 
	- degree of ionization,
	- extent of protein binding,
	- hydro- or lipophilicity
- residual ==renal== function
### Δ in tissue perfusion
In the presence of sepsis, the microcirculatory blood flow may be significantly impaired due to endothelial dysfunction and the presence of microthrombi, which decrease tissue perfusion. These alterations may lead to suboptimal antibiotic exposure at the site of infection and thereby to potential therapeutic failure, emergence of resistance, and higher morbidity.

Suboptimal tissue concentrations may even be found in patients with adequate plasma concentrations, as the antibiotic concentrations in plasma do not accurately reflect those in infected tissue

The main factors found to correlate with tissue penetration include oxygen saturation, serum lactate levels, and the dose per time unit of norepinephrine

### Δ from extracorporeal therapies
ECMO circuit can
- ==sequester== drugs,
- alter apparent ==Vd==,
	- drug sequestration
	- haemodilution from priming solution
		- ↓ impact on drugs w/ ↑ apparent Vd
			- e.g. quinolones
		- ↑ impact w/ ↓ Vd
			- ß lactam
			- aminoglycosides
- affect drug ==CL==
	- usually ↓ CL
		- ∵ ↓ renal / hepatic perfusion
	- many patients on ECMO also on RRT → ↑ complexity
degree of drug ==sequestration== depends on 
- physicochemical properties
	- lipophilicity
	- protein binding
- circuit factors
	- membrane surface area,
	- type of tubing,
	- oxygenator used,
	- priming solution
## PK/PD approaches for antimicrobials
PK/PD targets can be expressed as
- Cmax/MIC,
- %T > MIC,
- area under the curve (AUC)/MIC
depending on whether the antibiotic exhibits
- dose-,
- time-,
- AUC-dependent killing

In critically ill patients, 100% of time where the free concentration is above the MIC (100% fT > MIC) is often suggested as a therapeutic target for β-lactams

the use of a higher target ratio is based on the considerations of tissue diffusion and technical uncertainties pertaining to MIC and β-lactam concentration measurements. However, only observational studies have demonstrated higher PK/PD targets to offer improved microbiological and clinical remission without any notable impact on mortality

Actual MICs are considered to define the therapeutic range in documented infections. The turnaround time remains the main issue with the use of MICs

The epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) value, based on local ecology and the “worst-case scenario MIC” is the most common alternative used in this context. The “worst-case scenario MIC” refers to the highest MIC of susceptible pathogens that can be covered by the considered antibiotic. However, such approaches underestimate the probability of target attainment compared to actual MICs
