## ACOG definition of PET
==Blood pressure==
- Two readings >4h apart
	- SBP >/= ==140== mmHg
	- DBP >/= ==90== mmHg
	- after ==20 weeks== of gestation
	- in a woman with a ==previously normal== BP.
- Single reading
	- SBP >/= ==160== mmHg
	- DBP >/= ==110== mmHg
	- (Severe HT can be confirmed w/i a short interval (minutes) to facilitate timely anti-HT therapy)
==Proteinuria==
- >/= ==300== mg per 24-hour urine collection
	- (or this amount extrapolated from a timed collection) or
- PCR of 0.3 mg/dL or more or
- Dipstick reading of 2+
	- (used only if other quantitative methods are not available).
Or, in the ==absence of proteinuria==, new-onset ==hypertension== with the new onset of any of the following:
- [[Thrombocytopenia\|Thrombocytopenia]]
	- plt < ==100==x10^9/L.
- ==Renal insufficiency==
	- serum creatinine >1.1 mg/dL 
	- or a doubling of the serum creatinine in the absence of other renal disease
- Impaired liver function
	- ↑ liver ==transaminases== to ==twice== the normal concentration.
- Pulmonary edema.
- New-onset headache
	- unresponsive to medication
	- not accounted for by alternative diagnoses
- presence of ==visual== symptoms.

## Classification of PET
preeclampsia ==without severe features== if
- no end-organ dysfunction
- BP > 140/90 mmHg but < 160/110 mmHg
PET with ==severe features== if
- any of these symptoms are present, OR
- BP >160/110 mmHg

Some guidelines classify Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelet count (==HELLP==) syndrome and ==eclampsia== as severe forms of preeclampsia with predominantly ==hepatic== or ==neurologic== dysfunction

==HELLP== syndrome is characterized by
- severe thrombocytopenia
	- platelet < 100x10^9/L
- ↑ liver enzymes > twice the normal range
It may be associated with 
- ↑BP
- proteinuria
- other signs of organ damage.

==Eclampsia== is a severe, life-threatening form of preeclampsia in which the patient develops generalized tonic-clonic seizures

### Classification based on gestational age at onset
Only a small portion of the cases present at early gestational age; however, those are associated with high maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. 

The majority of preeclampsia cases present at ==term gestation== and have a ==milder== course. Thus, preeclampsia can be classified as 
- preterm
	- a/w delivery at <37 gestational weeks
- term
	- a/w delivery at 37 weeks or later
- postpartum preeclampsia
	- onset after delivery.

# Risk factors
clinical high risk factors
- chronic renal disease
- chronic HT
- DM
- autoimmune disease
- Hx of PET
- multifetal gestation
Moderate risk factors
- nulliparity
- maternal age >40
- interpregnancy interval >10y
- FHx of PET

# Pathophysiology
In preeclampsia, trophoblasts fail to differentiate into endothelial-like cells, resulting in ==poor trophoblast invasion== and ==incomplete spiral artery remodeling==. 
This leads to ==placental ischemia== and the release of ==inflammatory and vasoactive mediators ==into the maternal circulation, triggering downstream effects such as angiogenic imbalance and ==endothelial dysfunction==.
These changes result in a ==vasoconstrictive== state, oxidative stress, and ==microemboli==, contributing to the involvement of multiple organ systems and manifesting as the clinical features of preeclampsia

# Mx
## Antepartum Mx
most interventions have been unsuccessful, secondary to the multifactorial pathogenesis of the disease

## Aspirin
==Low-dose aspirin== is the most useful approach currently available to ==prevent severe== preeclampsia and ==delay== the onset of preeclampsia in individuals at increased risk

The beneficial effect of lower doses of aspirin (60-150 mg daily) is related to a reduction in platelet ==thromboxane== synthesis. Preeclampsia is associated with a functional imbalance between vascular prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 production, leading to increased platelet turnover

↓ PET incidence
↓ preterm birth <37wks
no sig. ↑ in adverse outcomes related to bleeding

For patients with ==two moderate== risk factors or ==one high-risk== factor, ACOG recommends initiating 81 mg aspirin daily between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation, ideally ==prior to 16== weeks, continued until delivery

==No consensus== exists regarding the timing of aspirin ==discontinuation==

strong evidence supports the recommendation of moderate-intensity ==exercise== of at least 140 minutes per week and ==calcium== supplementation in parturients with low baseline calcium intake (less than 900 mg per day)

## BP control
Effective blood pressure control is a mainstay in the management of preeclampsia to decrease maternal and fetal complications.
In the absence of pre-existing chronic hypertension, antihypertensive therapy should be expedited when blood pressure reaches or exceeds ==160/110 mmHg== and persists after repeat measurement 15 minutes later.

==Intravenous hydralazine or labetalol== and ==oral nifedipine== immediate release are the three agents most commonly used to treat severe acute hypertension

In those with ==pre-existing chronic hypertension==, the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy (==CHAP==) trial in 2022, a large, multicenter, randomized trial, demonstrated that antihypertensive treatment for mild chronic hypertension in pregnancy (blood pressure <160/105 mm Hg) to a goal (<140/90 mm Hg), primarily with ==labetalol== or ==nifedipine== compared with no treatment (unless blood pressure was severe), reduced the composite risk of
- superimposed preeclampsia with severe features,
- indicated preterm birth <35 weeks,
- placental abruption,
- fetal/neonatal death

As a result of this trial, professional societies in the US have recommended treatment of patients with chronic hypertension in pregnancy to a blood pressure goal of ==<140/90 mm Hg==. 
First-line agents for long-term blood pressure control include oral beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers, most commonly labetalol, nifedipine XL, and hydralazine

The benefits of antihypertensive treatment must be balanced against potential risks, as overly aggressive blood pressure reduction may ==compromise uteroplacental perfusion==, potentially leading to fetal growth restriction or distress

some antihypertensive medications such as ==ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers== remain ==contraindicated== in pregnancy due to their association with fetal renal dysfunction and other congenital anomalies

While ==HBPM== shows promise in improving hypertension management during pregnancy, it should be used as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, regular antenatal care and clinical assessments.

At this time, there is ==insufficient evidence== to conclude that home HBPM reduces severe maternal morbidity or mortality or reduces racial disparities in clinical outcomes
## Magnesium
Intravenous magnesium sulfate is a cornerstone in the management of preeclampsia with severe features and eclampsia, primarily for 
- seizure prophylaxis
- fetal neuroprotection

The landmark ==MAGPIE== Trial (2002) demonstrated that magnesium sulfate ==halves== the risk of eclampsia in women with preeclampsia

For ==seizure prophylaxis==, magnesium sulfate infusion begins at the ==start of labor or induction==, or prior to cesarean delivery and continues for ==12- 24 hours postpartum==

in patients with ==severe features== undergoing expectant management, magnesium is initiated in the setting of ==clinical instability==, usually upon initial presentation, such as for persistent severe range blood pressures, and may be ==discontinued with stabilization==

While the exact mechanism of seizure prophylaxis is unknown, magnesium’s efficacy is postulated to result from its role as a central nervous system depressant by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (==NMDA==) receptors and ==calcium channels==

Careful monitoring is crucial due to the ==narrow therapeutic index== of magnesium

The therapeutic range of magnesium is ==4.8-8.4 mg/dL==, however data supporting these values are limited

The most common regimen for achieving a therapeutic level expeditiously while also minimizing adverse effects consists of 
- IV ==4-6 g loading== bolus over 20-30 min, 
- maintenance dose of ==1-2 g/h==

When IV access is not feasible, magnesium sulfate can be given ==intramuscularly== (IM) at a dose of 10 g (5 g IM in each buttock) and then 5 g every 4 hours. In order to reduce pain with IM injection, magnesium can be mixed with 1 mL of lidocaine 2% solution

In the setting of ==renal insufficiency==, there is a higher risk of magnesium toxicity given magnesium is almost exclusively renally excreted.
In these situations, the maintenance infusion dose may need to be reduced from 2g/h to ==1g/h== or may need to be discontinued altogether with the plan to administer boluses as needed based on serum magnesium levels checked every 4-6 hours.

Individuals receiving magnesium for seizure prophylaxis may experience
- nausea,
- vomiting,
- flushing,
- drowsiness,
- weakness,
- confusion

The magnesium infusion should be discontinued if a magnesium serum level exceeds ==9.6 mg/dL (8 mEq/L)==, and the level should be checked every 2 h with reinitiation of the infusion when serum levels fall below 8.4 mg/dL (7 mEq/L).

==Hypermagnesemia== is treated with intravenous ==calcium gluconate== 10% solution, 10 mL over 3 minutes

==Magnesium toxicity== should be suspected, ruled out, and rapidly treated in parturients who suffer ==cardiac arrest== with ongoing or recent magnesium therapy, particularly if no other etiologies are confirmed

Important considerations for when magnesium is ==contraindicated== include 
- myasthenia gravis,
- hypocalcemia,
- moderate to severe renal failure,
- acute myocardial infarction,
- heart block,
- myocarditis.
In these cases, ==benzodiazepines== or ==levetiracetam== can be used for alternative seizure prophylaxis

## Timing and mode of delivery
Patients with preeclampsia without severe features may be expectantly managed until ==37== weeks’ gestation when delivery is indicated

Delivery for preeclampsia with ==severe features== is indicated at ==34 weeks’== gestation

Mode of delivery is based on standard obstetric indications
# Anaesthetic Mx

==Diastolic dysfunction== is the hallmark of cardiovascular dysfunction in preeclampsia

Neuraxial anesthesia is associated with sympathetic blockade and modest afterload reduction, both of which are beneficial for blood pressure control and diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, in the absence of contraindications, [[pages/epidural anaesthesia\|EA]] should be initiated wherever possible and as early as possible in women with preeclampsia in active labor

There are a number of ==considerations== when evaluating the risk of neuraxial anesthesia. ==Coagulopathy== associated with preeclampsia, particularly in patients with HELLP syndrome or thrombocytopenia, may increase the risk of epidural hematoma, and thus, the use of neuraxial analgesia is relatively contraindicated. 
Historically, societal guidelines specify a higher risk of this complication with platelet counts of ==< 70 x 10^9/L==. Recently amended guidelines from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology propose a more liberal range

If thrombocytopenia is present, the platelet count should be checked before spinal / epidural placement, and epidural catheter removal.

The ==sFlt-1:PlGF ratio== is used as a screening tool to predict the development of severe preeclampsia over the next two weeks

The ==attenuation== of the hypertensive response to ==intubation== can be achieved using one or a combination of several drugs
The first is ==magnesium== sulfate, which can be given to obtund catecholamine release as a ==bolus of 30 mg/kg IV== immediately after induction of anesthesia in magnesium-treated patients and ==45 mg/kg== if the patient is magnesium naïve

Hypoxemia in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is twice as likely compared to normotensive patients

# Postpartum Mx
In patients with preeclampsia diagnosed in the ante- and intrapartum periods, the main postpartum efforts are focused on ==managing ↑BP==
