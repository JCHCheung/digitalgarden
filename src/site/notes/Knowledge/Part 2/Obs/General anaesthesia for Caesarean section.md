# General anaesthesia for C section

indication 
- ==speed== i.e. Cat 1 CS
- C/I to SA
- patient refusal

GA still fasting than rapid sequence SA (taking ~8min)

aspiration risk
reduce risk by lowering acidity with non-particulate antacids

Na citrate lasting around 30min

?? H2 blocker or PPI AFTER intubation (to reduce risk for extubation)

# [[Knowledge/Medicine/Difficult airway\|Difficult airway]]
higher risk of ==difficult== or ==failed== intubation - 1:49 and 1:808 respectively, compared to non-pregnant patients

The physiologic changes of pregnancy affecting the airway and respiratory system include more vascular and ==edematous== upper respiratory tract mucosa, with increased risk of tissue ==friability==, bleeding and swelling with airway manipulation.
These changes may be exaggerated in the setting of [[pages/Preeclampsia\|preeclampsia]], [[pages/Oxytocin\|oxytocin]] and IV fluid administration and after ==Valsalva== maneuvers during the 2nd stage of labor

After induction of anesthesia, oxygen desaturation with apnea is accelerated in parturients due to ↓ FRC and ↑ O2 consumption

[[cricoid pressure\|cricoid pressure]] is traditionally applied with an initial force of 10 N and increasing to 30 N with loss of consciousness

==Gentle positive pressure== is now also recommended immediately preceding the first attempt of laryngoscopy to 
- ↓ O2 desaturation
- estimate the likelihood of successful BMV should it be required

The risk of ==pulmonary aspiration== is ↑ ∵
- progesterone-induced ↓ gastroesophageal sphincter tone
- delayed [[Knowledge/Part 2/Obs/Gastric emptying in pregnancy\|Gastric emptying in pregnancy]]
	- a/w pain and opioid administration

# Difference from other GA:
Prep & drape BEFORE induction: need good communication with patient
[[pages/rapid sequence induction\|RSI]]
- ↓ aspiration risk
- ↓ time of fetal exposure to anaesthetic agents

Gentle mask ventilation with peak inspiratory pressure <==20 cm H2O== with or without cricoid pressure is considered to be safe to maintain oxygen saturation between intubation attempts if needed, while limiting the risk of gastric insufflation with gases
(OAA + DAS 2015 guideline) 

(pearl: if some drugs can cross BBB → likely it can cross placenta)

incision w/i seconds of induction
→ leading to hypertension (could lead to Cx esp in [[pages/Preeclampsia\|PET]] patients)

## Delivery:
Apgar at 1min usually lower ∵ we anaesthetise the baby as well

implication
- need another person e.g. paed to resuscitate the baby
- need to communicate with that personnel RE: drug given to mother

## Drug dose:
trade off btwn mother VS baby

Prevention of awareness
- amnestic e.g. midazolam after delivery
- adv of sux ∵ mother can move if aware
- N2O ∵ ↓ MAC
- monitor
	- end-tidal gas
	- brain monitor
Although rapid placental transfer occurs with lipophilic induction agents and opioids are not routinely administered, alfentanil, remifentanil, sufentanil or fentanyl are advisable in cases of severe hypertension, cardiac disease, or neurologic compromise to blunt the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation

High-dose volatile anesthetic agents such as sevoflurane with high gas flows may be initiated to quickly obtain end-tidal concentrations of 1 MAC before delivery; however, because of dose-dependent uterine relaxation effects, after delivery MAC should be lowered to 0.5 – 0.75, with supplementation with nitrous oxide 50 – 70%
### Volatile as [[Knowledge/Part 2/Obs/Tocolytics\|Tocolytics]]
usual rule: limit volatile agent to ==0.5 MAC== to minimise tocolytic effects
