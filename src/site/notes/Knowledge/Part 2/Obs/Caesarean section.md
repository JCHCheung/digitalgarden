# Caesarean section

Caesarean delivery (CD) is the most performed inpatient surgery worldwide


Enhanced Recovery After Caesarean (ERAC) builds upon ERAS principles to address the unique needs and challenges of obstetric patients

# Sedative agents
Sedating medications are typically avoided during CD to limit depressant effects for the fetus and maternal amnesia. However, small doses of sedative medications such as midazolam 0.02 mg/kg IV or 30-50% nitrous oxide may be safely administered when needed

# Abx prophylaxis
Single dose first-generation cephalosporins (e.g., IV cefazolin 1 - 2g for patients <80 kg or >80 kg respectively) are the first-line antibiotic unless allergies exist. A higher dose is recommended (IV cefazolin 3g) for patients >120 kg

Alternatively, a single-dose combination of clindamycin and an aminoglycoside can be administered preoperatively

Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for all CDs within 60 minutes before the start of surgery unless the patient is already receiving antibiotics with an equivalent spectrum coverage, e.g., for chorioamnionitis

If not administered, such as in an emergency, antibiotics should be given as soon as possible after surgical incision. Surgical antimicrobial standards further dictate redosing antibiotics within ==2 half-lives== of the agent or ==at >1500 mL== blood loss

# [[Knowledge/Medicine/Neuraxial block\|Neuraxial block]]
Neuraxial anaesthesia is recommended for CD by SOAP, the Obstetric Anaesthetists' Association, American Pain Society and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence

Bupivacaine, a long-acting local anesthetic, is the most common intrathecal agent used for CD. The ==hyperbaric== form co-administered with opioids (==ED95 11.2 mg== for success) and isobaric form (ED95 13 mg for success) are similarly effective, although some evidence suggests more rapid sensory block onset with the hyperbaric formulation

Long-acting opioids such as intrathecal morphine produce postoperative analgesia lasting 13 - 33 hours

Intrathecal fentanyl and ITM are the preferred neuraxial adjuvants to local anaesthetic agents for CD anesthesia and analgesia. A dose-response study showed that 50 mcg ITM was as effective as 100 and 150 mcg

although the 50-mcg morphine dose has shown similar effectiveness to the 100 and 150 mcg dose with less pruritus and also likely less risk of respiratory depression, higher doses may benefit patients anticipated to have more severe pain, such as patients with a history of chronic pelvic pain

A meta-analysis concluded that high doses >100 mcg were more likely to be associated with adverse side effects

It is important to identify women with increased risk of ==respiratory depression==, as they might require more intensive postoperative monitoring after ITM. The rate of clinically significant respiratory depression following contemporary doses of ITM is 1.08-1.63 per 10,000

## Testing adequacy of block
The onset of sensory blockade to cold occurs before and at a higher level than pinprick, and both before and higher than touch, corresponding to inhibition of C, A delta and A beta fibers respectively

Cold > pinprick > touch

Evidence of ==S1 block (plantar flexion)== is common with spinal anesthesia but infrequent with epidural anesthesia

==Inadequate sacral anesthesia== may be present if normal ankle motor function is observed and is likely to result in ==intraoperative pain==

## [[pages/Neuraxial anaesthesia induced hypotension in CS\|Neuraxial anaesthesia induced hypotension in CS]]
## Intra-op pain
Breakthrough pain may occur despite an apparently adequate block

Intraoperative pain risks negative psychological consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and is a cause of successful ==medicolegal claims==

The Obstetric Anaesthetists’ Association recommends that the ==upper and lower limit== of the sensory block and motor block should be tested, that complaints of pain should be acknowledged and managed with IV supplementation of opioids that have rapid onset including ==fentanyl==(25-50µg) or ==remifentanil== with low-dose ==ketamine== (10mg).

==Conversion to GA== should be discussed with the patient and performed if effective analgesia is not achieved

# IONV
Steps to prevent intra- and postoperative nausea and vomiting include avoiding hypotension, avoiding uterine exteriorization and administering a combination of prophylactic IV agents, including a 5-HT3 antagonist such as ondansetron 4 mg, or a glucocorticoid such as dexamethasone 4 to 8 mg

## SOAP guideline
The 25 interventions that SOAP recommends are: 
- limiting the duration of fasting; 
- nonparticulate liquid carbohydrate loading; 
- patient education;
- promotion of breastfeeding and maternal-infant bonding; 
- hemoglobin optimisation; 
- prevention and treatment of hypotension caused by spinal anesthesia; 
- maintenance of normothermia;
- optimising uterotonic administration; 
- antibiotic prophylaxis; 
- initiation of multimodal analgesia; 
- IONV/PONV prophylaxis;
- intravenous (IV) fluid optimisation; 
- delayed umbilical cord clamping; 
- venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, 
- encouraging rest periods; 
- early mobilisation; 
- early urinary catheter removal; 
- early oral intake; 
- facilitating early discharge; 
- anaemia remediation; 
- breastfeeding support;
- multimodal analgesia; 
- glucose control; 
- promotion of the return of bowel function

## ERAS guideline
The ERAS Society has few recommendations specific to CD. They include delayed cord-clamping, prioritizing a transverse uterine hysterotomy, use of subcuticular sutures, and removal of the urinary catheter in the immediate postoperative period

PROSPECT guidelines recommend the use of ==postpartum epidural analgesia for OUD==, due to the significantly increased postoperative opioid requirements expected.

Current evidence suggests that the relatively low occurrence of chronic pain after CD compared to other surgical procedures may be attributed to factors such as neuraxial anaesthesia and potential protective effects from endogenous oxytocin secretion

Neuraxial anaesthesia during CD, particularly when intrathecal opioids are administered, may play a role in preventing the development of chronic pain, although current evidence does not support the role of intrathecal morphine (ITM) for this purpose



# Opioids analgesics
==Oral== opioids such as oxycodone or hydrocodone should be preferentially prescribed unless the patient is intolerant of oral intake since greater opioid side effects are associated with the IV route of administration

## Non-opioids analgesics
paracetamol & NSAID safe for breast feeding

NSAIDs should be prescribed in a ==scheduled== manner rather than as-needed, as this strategy has been shown to reduce opioid consumption following caesarean delivery

## Dexamethasone
Intravenous dexamethasone during CD has been associated with ==better pain scores== and ==prolonged analgesia== with reduced need for further ==anti-emetics==

## Gabapentin
Gabapentin exerts its analgesic effect by modulating the activity of ==voltage-gated calcium channels== and enhancing GABA inhibitory neurotransmission. These mechanisms are thought to reduce pain signaling and dampen the central sensitization associated with postoperative pain

not much use in CS
## Nerve blocks

### TAP block
↓ pain if no ITM in first 24h
?? in the presence of ITM

### QL block
↓ pain if no ITM

### Would infiltration / catheters
no additional benefit if ITM present
