# Peripartum anticoagulation
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality

The risk of VTE increases approximately 5x during pregnancy, and 20x in the postpartum period

The main factors associated with VTE during pregnancy are 
- hypercoagulability,
- immunomodulation
- venous stasis.

Indications for anticoagulation during pregnancy include
- a history of VTE,
- recognised risk for VTE
	- homozygous factor V Leiden,
	- protein S and C deficiencies, 
	- prothrombin gene mutation 
- recurrent pregnancy loss
- other
	- AF
	- valvular heart

# [[pages/unfractionated heparin\|UFH]]& [[LMWH\|LMWH]]
Unfractionated heparin and LMWHs ==do not cross the placenta== and can be safely used during pregnancy

Unfractionated heparin is a heterogenous mixture of high molecular weight molecules ==(3000–30,000 Daltons)==

LMWHs are derived from UFH, with a molecular weight of 4000–5000 Daltons

The ==higher ratio of anti-Xa and anti-II activity== of [[LMWH\|LMWH]] allows their use to balance effective antithrombotic activity with a lower bleeding risk

LMWHs also have a lower associated risk of ==heparin-induced thrombocytopenia== given that they bind ==platelet factor 4== less and have fewer effects on platelet aggregation, function and activation

[[pages/unfractionated heparin\|UFH]] is typically only used for thromboprophylaxis if the patient has an allergy to LMWH or has a contraindication such as renal failure.

Typical UFH doses for VTE ==prophylaxis== in pregnancy are
- 5000–7500 units Q12 h in the 1st trimester,
- 7500–10,000 units Q12 h in the 2nd trimester
- 10,000 units Q12 h in the 3rd trimester

Dosing requirements increase over the course of pregnancy as ==blood volume==, [[GFR\|GFR]] and ==protein binding== of heparin all increase

==Therapeutic== UFH is used less frequently but is dosed at 10,000 units Q12 h, targeting an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 1.5–2.5 times control 6 h after injection

==Prophylactic== LMWHs, including enoxaparin, dalteparin and tinzaparin, are typically dosed once daily

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations are based on ==fixed== dosing, whereas Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recommendations are ==weight-adjusted==

## Highlow study
multinational RCT
1110 pregnant women w/ previous Hx of VTE
weight-adjusted intermediate dose LMWH VS fixed low-dose
1° outcome: confirmed VTE event

NO DIFFERENCE

patients in the Highlow study were instructed to ==stop== their anticoagulant dose at the first signs of labour, or at 24 h before planned delivery

19% vs 39% ineligible to receive [[Knowledge/Medicine/Neuraxial block\|Neuraxial block]] due to unplanned onset of labour

# Fondaparinux
Fondaparinux is a heparin-like drug that should only be used with advice from a haematologist, and reserved for patients intolerant of heparin-containing medications

Of particular concern is its long (17 h) half-life

Fondaparinux should be held for 36–42 h before neuraxial blockade or catheter removal; 6–12 h should elapse after neuraxial blockade or catheter removal before restarting the medication

# Warfarin
Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist less frequently used during pregnancy given its ==teratogenicity== and ability to ==cross the placenta==
use during the ==6th to 12th weeks== of pregnancy poses the greatest risk

warfarin is superior to LMWH for the prevention of ==mechanical heart valve== thrombosis and may be selected for certain patients with mechanical heart valves ==after the first trimester==, for whom adequate anticoagulation is critical for safety

==Reversal== of warfarin with either vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be needed at the time of delivery, given the risk of ==maternal retroplacental bleeding== and ==fetal intracerebral haemorrhage== near term.

Although warfarin is less frequently encountered in labouring patients, ASRA and ESAIC/ESRA recommend warfarin be ==stopped for 5 days== before a neuraxial procedure, with a normal international normalised ratio (INR) level seen before proceeding

pregnant women with mechanical heart valves on warfarin should switch from warfarin to twice daily LMWH by ==36 weeks== of pregnancy (or 2 weeks before planned birth, whichever is earlier); LMWH should be monitored with anti-Xa levels

Warfarin is safe for ==lactating== patients

ASRA recommends that epidural catheters should be removed while the ==INR remains <1.5==, ideally within ==12–24 h== of re-initiating warfarin


# DOAC
Safety profile in pregnancy not well established
→ typically avoided during pregnancy

All DOACs can cross into ==breast milk==, and their use during breastfeeding is discouraged because of a relatively unknown safety profile and lack of available studies on the amount of transfer that occurs

# Aspirin
Women at risk for [[pages/Preeclampsia\|PET]] are recommended to take between 75 and 150 mg of aspirin daily, starting at ==12 weeks==' gestation, through delivery

==Any== of the following high-risk conditions are indications for aspirin prophylaxis: 
- hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy, 
- chronic hypertension, 
- chronic kidney disease, 
- systemic lupus erythematosus, 
- antiphospholipid syndrome,
- diabetes mellitus

==More than one== of the following moderate risk factors is also considered an indication for aspirin:
- nulliparity, 
- age ≥40 yrs, 
- interpregnancy interval of >10 yrs,
- pre-pregnancy body mass index ≥35 kg/m^2,
- family history of pre-eclampsia,
- multiple gestation
# Anaes considerations
Typically, obstetric plans to stop anticoagulant drugs before delivery are related more to the concern for neuraxial haematoma than the risk of bleeding around delivery

Spinal haematoma: neurological recovery was worse if spinal decompression was delayed >12 h after initial presenting symptoms

Neuraxial haematoma most commonly presents with symptoms of spinal cord compression, including progressive sensory block and lower extremity motor weakness or bowel or bladder incontinence

Back pain occurs in a minority of patients, and radicular pain may or may not co-present with back pain

==Safety== guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists and the Obstetric Anaesthetists' Association exist to aid in ==early detection== of vertebral canal haematoma and timely escalation of care

These guidelines include recommendations for the anaesthetist to be alerted for ==abnormal motor block== during labour or ==abnormal recovery== from neuraxial blockade, including the inability to raise the ==heel off the bed== against gravity during labour or the inability to perform a ==straight leg raise at 4 h== after the last dose of local anaesthetic.

Neurological symptoms typically evolve ==24–48 h== after a neuraxial procedure and warrant immediate neurological consultation and imaging, with magnetic resonance imaging being the imaging modality of choice to most sensitively and specifically diagnose neuraxial haematoma

If neuraxial haematoma is detected, emergency neurosurgical consultation and decompressive laminectomy are needed, ideally ==within 8 h== of the onset of symptoms

medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that might increase bleeding risk should be held until the ==epidural catheter== is withdrawn if thromboprophylaxis is continued; women ==without an epidural catheter== in situ do not need to have NSAIDs withheld even if they are receiving thromboprophylaxis after neuraxial blockade


> [!NOTE] ACOG guideline
> The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that anticoagulation therapy be restarted no sooner than 4–6 h after vaginal delivery and no sooner than 6–12 h after Caesarean delivery; timing of the last neuraxial anaesthetic must also be taken into account

# Antepartum planning
Patients at particularly high risk for difficult airway, operative delivery, or preterm delivery may be candidates for bridging from LMWH to low-dose UFH at around 36 weeks' gestation

Patients who are hospitalised antenatally and require thromboprophylaxis warrant close consideration by the obstetric and anaesthesia teams as the clinical situation evolves. Such patients often have underlying morbidities, risk for imminent delivery, or both, and use of ==UFH== affords ==highest flexibility== for management of anaesthesia.

There is currently ==little evidence== for the use of point-of-care anticoagulation testing to assess suitability for neuraxial anaesthesia

If patients are receiving neuraxial [[pages/Labour analgesia\|labour analgesia]], using low concentration local anaesthetics may limit the extent of motor block during labour, to allow for ==concurrent assessment of epidural haematoma==.
