# Peripartum cardiomyopathy
![](https://i.imgur.com/RkrG6bg.png)
# Background
Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a form of ==acute== and sometimes severe cardiac degeneration that leads to clinical heart failure during pregnancy or in the early postpartum period

Approximately 60% of cases of cardiogenic shock during pregnancy or in the early postpartum period are caused by peripartum cardiomyopathy

Sixty to ninety percent of cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy occur after delivery, with the highest incidence in the first postpartum week

Although cardiac function typically recovers in more than 50% of affected patients, morbidity and mortality are nevertheless high, with some patients requiring a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or cardiac transplantation

## Definition
Classical definition
- maternal heart failure
	- systolic dysfunction
		- LVEF ==<45%==
- develops in the ==last month== of pregnancy or in the ==first 5 months== after delivery
- in the absence of known preexisting cardiac dysfunction
- Dx of exclusion

The ==2010== Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group revised the definition of PPCM to “an idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting with HF secondary to LV systolic dysfunction towards the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery, where no other cause of heart failure is found”
## Risk factors
- hypertensive diseases of pregnancy
	- including [[pages/Preeclampsia\|Preeclampsia]]
- multiple gestations
- advanced maternal age
- anaemia
- ethnicity: black > white
MOD (e.g. CS) not a risk factor

## Diagnosis
The majority of women with PPCM are diagnosed after delivery, typically in the first month postpartum

Presentation: heart failure, cardiogenic shock

Infrequently, affected persons present with a complication of the disease, such as an arrhythmia or a thromboembolic event

Although there is no specific ECG pattern for PPCM, at initial evaluation, the ECG is rarely normal and repolarization abnormalities are common

==Genetic== testing is increasingly offered to patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy, and it should be considered in most cases

# Pathogenesis
Peripartum cardiomyopathy has often been proposed to represent a ==failed hemodynamic stress test==. However, the disorder typically develops after delivery, and systolic function appears to be preserved earlier during gestation

the maximal cardiovascular changes occur in the ==second trimester==, when most women with pre-existing cardiac disease develop symptomatic HF
cf PPCM: late pregnancy

![](https://i.imgur.com/8Vz2rwM.png)

[[Myocarditis\|Myocarditis]] has also been suggested to cause peripartum cardiomyopathy, but endomyocardial biopsy specimens from patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy do not appear to contain any more viral genomes that have been implicated in myocarditis than do control specimens, and cardiovascular MRI studies with late gadolinium enhancement in women with peripartum cardiomyopathy of recent onset rarely reveal evidence of myocarditis

Studies have suggested that the disorder is triggered by ==hormones== that emanate from the pituitary and placenta during the peripartum period, synergizing, in ways still poorly understood, with intrinsic cardiac factors that render some women susceptible to these hormonal imbalances.

Hormones produced by the ==pituitary== and the ==placenta== normally modulate maternal physiology to support fetal and newborn growth and development. Under certain circumstances, however, some of these processes can lead to cardiac dysfunction

==2 vascular-hormonal animal models==: 16-kD prolactin

[[prolactin\|prolactin]], secreted from the ==pituitary== in late gestation and after delivery in lactating persons, was shown in mouse models of peripartum cardiomyopathy to be cleaved to a breakdown product that damages the cardiac vasculature. The damaged vessels, in turn, trigger ventricular systolic dysfunction through a combination of cardiac ischemia and paracrine signaling, including the secretion by endothelial cells of exosomes containing microRNAs (miRNAs) that, when taken up by cardiomyocytes, promote cardiomyocyte apoptosis

suppression of [[prolactin\|prolactin]] secretion, either by ==pharmacologic== means or by ==cessation of breast-feeding==, may be beneficial in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy

Of note, human [[prolactin\|prolactin]] has been shown to be more ==resistant to cleavage== than prolactin in rats, and extrapolations from rodent models may be limited

[[pages/Oxytocin\|Oxytocin]], which is secreted by the pituitary to promote lactation, can also have vasculotoxic effects, promoting postpartum aortic dissection in models of Marfan’s syndrome, but a definitive role in peripartum cardiomyopathy has not been directly established.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7Z2n9AR.png)

Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), a soluble decoy receptor for VEGF that is abundantly secreted by the ==placenta== in late gestation, has been shown to trigger cardiovascular rarefaction, leading to peripartum cardiomyopathy in mice. The latter observation may explain the strong epidemiologic associations of [[pages/Preeclampsia\|preeclampsia]] and ==multiple gestations== with peripartum cardiomyopathy, because large increases in placental secretion of sFlt-1 are seen in both contexts

The ==late-gestation placenta== is also abundantly steroidogenic. [[Progesterone\|Progesterone]], highly secreted by the placenta, suppresses the burning of carbohydrates by the heart, promotes cardiac hypertrophy, and may have direct negative-inotropic effects, all of which probably sensitize the heart to further insults

Approximately 15% of women with peripartum cardiomyopathy have heterozygous loss-of-function genetic variants in one of several genes known to be associated with nonischemic [[dilated cardiomyopathy\|dilated cardiomyopathy]], a disease that in part resembles peripartum cardiomyopathy

The frequencies of identified variants in [[dilated cardiomyopathy\|dilated cardiomyopathy]] and in peripartum cardiomyopathy are nearly identical, suggesting that these two diseases may lie on a spectrum, reflecting different environmental insults superimposed on the background of a similar genetic predisposition to disease

==Selenium== deficiency appears to contribute to peripartum cardiomyopathy in some parts of Nigeria, through unknown mechanisms

# Management

![](https://i.imgur.com/w9MRGRR.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/ofssZrC.png)

Current management is thus largely extrapolated from guideline-directed medical treatment for nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and other forms of heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction

Neurohormonal blockade with angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists can be administered after delivery but are ==contraindicated before delivery==

[[Hydralazine\|Hydralazine]] plus isosorbide dinitrate is an alternative regimen for ==afterload reduction== during pregnancy

==Beta-blockers== are routinely indicated and are safe during pregnancy

No data on entresto & SGLT2i but often used post-partum

## SCD / arrhythmia
==Ventricular arrhythmias== are common in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy

Given the high rate of improvement of LV function during optimal heart failure drug therapy, ==early implantation== of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in patients with newly diagnosed PPCM is generally ==not advisable==

==Wearable cardioverter-defibrillators== (WCDs) have been proposed as a mechanism to prevent sudden cardiac death during the ==first 3–6 months== after diagnosis until a definitive decision about ICD implantation can be made
## Anticoagulation
The ==hypercoagulable== state of pregnancy, especially the peripartum period, increases the risk of thrombotic complications, including left ventricular thrombus and thromboembolic events, which occur in 5 to 20% of cases

anticoagulation should be considered in the setting of severely decreased LVEF during late pregnancy and 6 to 8 weeks postpartum

> [!NOTE] Guidelines
> Anticoagulation is suggested by the AHA when the LVEF is <30%, whereas the ESC suggests using LVEF ≤35% as the threshold

## Heart transplant
Patients with PPCM appear to have higher rates of graft failure and death after heart transplantation, which may be partly explained by higher allosensitization, higher pre-transplant acuity, and increased rejection

As late recovery beyond 6–12 months is possible and outcomes with heart transplantation in PPCM are worse than in other causes of heart failure, ==delaying heart transplantation== as long as possible is desirable.
## Delivery
Patients who are hemodynamically stable can deliver vaginally

==Epidural analgesia== is preferred

Following delivery, removal of caval compression by the fetus, autotransfusion due to uterine contractions, and fluid mobilization and resorption contribute to an increase in venous return. The post-partum risk of fluid overload and pulmonary edema must be anticipated.

## Lactation / Bromocriptine
==Lactation== is generally not contraindicated

There are no proven disease-specific therapies for peripartum cardiomyopathy, but the use of [[pages/Bromocriptine\|Bromocriptine]] to suppress the release of prolactin from the pituitary is currently under investigation and may be considered in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%.

> [!NOTE] Guidelines
> 2018 ESC guidelines include a weak recommendation (Class IIb, Level of Evidence: B) for the use of bromocriptine. Due to the association with thrombotic complications, therapeutic anticoagulation is recommended in conjunction with bromocriptine.

A bromocriptine treatment scheme has been suggested: 
bromocriptine (2.5 mg once daily) for at least 1 week may be considered in ==uncomplicated== cases

prolonged treatment (2.5 mg twice daily for 2 weeks, then 2.5 mg once daily for another 6 weeks) may be applied in patients with EF < 25%, right ventricular involvement, intensive care treatment, and/or cardiogenic shock
# Outcome
In most women, the LVEF increases to ==more than 50%== within ==6 months== after diagnosis

Implantation of an LVAD or heart transplantation is required in up to ==10%== of cases

mortality among patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy can be as high as ==20%==, and it is higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries, despite a generally lower incidence of known risk factors in low-income countries

The occurrence of [[pages/Preeclampsia\|preeclampsia]] with peripartum cardiomyopathy has been associated with better left ventricular recovery and with a higher incidence of adverse cardiovascular outcomes

## Contraception & future pregnancy
In the early postpartum setting with severe LV dysfunction, the increased risk of thromboembolism should dissuade the use of ==estrogen-containing contraceptives==

Progesterone-releasing subcutaneous implants or the Mirena intrauterine device are safe and effective choices

In a woman with persistent LV dysfunction, the risk of a subsequent pregnancy likely outweighs any risk associated with contraception


> [!NOTE] ESC Guideline
> 2018 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy discourage subsequent pregnancy if the LVEF is not >50% to 55%

Women who recover LVEF >50% have lower risk of complications during a subsequent pregnancy, but there is still increased risk of recurrent HF
## Subsequent pregnancy
The risks associated with a subsequent pregnancy depend primarily upon whether the myocardial function has fully recovered, and the pre-pregnancy LVEF is the strongest predictor of outcomes
