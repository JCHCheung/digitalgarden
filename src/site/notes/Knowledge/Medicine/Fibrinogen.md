Fibrinogen (Factor I) is converted to [[Fibrin\|Fibrin]] (Factor Ia) by [[thrombin\|thrombin]] (Factor IIa)
==Insoluble== Fibrin polymerizes to form a three-dimensional matrix stabilized by Factor XIIIa which supports
- platelet aggregation,
- mature clot formation,
- clot stability, 
- retraction

In healthy individuals, normal plasma fibrinogen levels range from ==1.5 to 3.5 g/L==

fibrinogen also serves as an ==acute phase reactant== and may be elevated in many physiologic states. ↑ fibrinogen are a/w
- infection,
- inflammation,
- cardiovascular disease
- recent trauma,
- ==pregnancy==

In the ==3rd trimester== of pregnancy, normal fibrinogen levels are typically closer to ==5 g/L==


Fibrinogen is one of the first coagulation factors to be ==depleted== with large volume hemorrhage, and existing clinical studies suggest targeting a plasma fibrinogen concentration of at least ==1.5–2 g/L== in both cardiac surgical patients and trauma patients, as plasma fibrinogen concentrations below this threshold are associated with excess bleeding and adverse clinical outcomes

In the ==obstetric== population, fibrinogen levels less than 2 g/L are associated with worse outcomes, although practice guidelines may still offer a target fibrinogen ranging from 1.5 to 2 g/L
Several authors advocate for treatment thresholds >3 g/L in this population, but existing evidence suggests that fibrinogen replacement is unlikely to improve outcomes when the serum fibrinogen is ==concentration >2 g/L==

Fibrinogen concentrate is a pooled plasma-derived product prepared as a sterile, pathogen-reduced, concentrate powder.
It contains a standardized fibrinogen content of 20 mg/mL when reconstituted

The dose of fibrinogen concentrate can be calculated based on
- target plasma fibrinogen level,
- measured plasma fibrinogen level, 
- body weight

Dose (mg/kg body weight) = (Target Level (mg/dL) – Measured Level (mg/dL))/(1.8 (mg/dL per mg/kg body weight))

A typical adult dose is 4g (approx. ==70 mg/kg==) and would typically raise the plasma fibrinogen by ==1 g/L==
