## Receptors
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ruf4zfK.png)
### V1 = V1a
acting on ==vascular smooth muscle cell==
→ vasoconstriction
### V2
acting on renal collecting ducts
→ ==antidiuretic== effect → free water resorption

release vWF & F8
### V3 = V1b
pituitary stimulation → ACTH production

(cross reactivity with [[oxytocin\|oxytocin]])
## Analogues
Vials: ==synthetic== vasopressin
### Desmopressin
= DDAVP (brand name)
synthetic analogue of ADH
==D==-arginine for L-arginine at position 8; position 1 ==d==eaminated
→ V2 specificity
for DI, vWF & F8
### Terlipressin
V1 specificity
- V1/V2 ratio ~==2.2==
	- (cf vasopressin 1:1)
longer acting
labelled for HRS
# Trauma
AVERT shock trial
# Septic shock
2021 SSC guidelines note that: initiating vasopressin when the patient requires between ==0.25 - 0.5 μg/kg/min== of norepinephrine “seems sensible.”

==exogenous== administration of vasopressin in patients with septic shock may be considered ==hormone replacement== therapy ∵ the findings that:
- AVP concentrations appropriately ↑ in the ==early== phase of septic shock 
- then quickly ↓ to subtherapeutic concentrations within the ==first 24 h== after shock onset

## limiting exogenous catecholamine dose
Catecholamines exert their hemodynamic effects through activity at adrenergic α-receptors and β-receptors. These receptors are susceptible to downregulation and desensitization in states of shock, often necessitating higher doses to sustain hemodynamic augmentation

other ADR from catecholamine e.g. arrhythmia, immunomodulation

Norepinephrine enhances antiinflammatory IL-10 response and attenuates the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha, whereas vasopressin exhibits no immunomodulatory effects

## Important trials
### VASST 2008
- septic shock
- NA vs NA + AVP
- overall no difference in mortality
- ?lower all cause mortality in some subgroups
### VANISH 2016
- septic shock
- NA vs AVP as 1st vasopressor
- no difference in mortality & kidney failure-free days
- but ↓ RRT?

(3rd trial in abstract form: Oliveira et al 2014)

Meta-analysis: ↓ mortality a/w AVP agonist use

## Important research questions
Can patients who will respond to vasopressin’s initiation be identified preemptively?
When is the most ideal time during the course of shock to initiate vasopressin in a patient?
What clinical marker should be used as an indicator for vasopressin’s initiation?
What is the maximum safe vasopressin dose?
Should the vasopressin dosage be titrated?
What therapeutic intervention should be undertaken in individuals who do not respond to vasopressin initiation?
How should vasopressin be discontinued in patients in the convalescent phase?

# Drug dose

### DI
- AVP 0.25 - 1 unit/hour
- DDAVP 
	- PO 0.1mg daily to 0.3mg TDS
		- unpredictable absorption
### Shock
- AVP 0.03 - 0.04 units/==min==
- = 1.8 - 2.4 units/hour
(high dose than DI)
## Haemostasis
one off IV DDAVP 0.3 - 0.4 µg/kg
approx. 20-40 µg
→ ~10x higher than DI dose
effect max in ~30min
## Push dose AVP
EM Case report used 1 unit dilute to 1 unit/ml in post-arrest hypotension
recommends 0.5-1 u every 2-5 minutes, onset ~2 minutes, duration 5-20 minutes

### Mixing Instructions from J Emerg Med Case Report (1 U/mL))
- Obtain a 20 mL syringe filled with 19 mL of 0.9% saline
- Inject one mL of vasopressin (20 unit per mL) into the syringe.
- Shake syringe well. This will now give you one unit per mL. Administer 0.5-1 mL (0.5-1 unit) every two to five minutes titrating to desired blood pressure.

### Mixing Instructions from Perioperative Push-Dose Pressor Paper (0.4 U/mL)
- Use 2 vials of 20 unit/mL vasopressin to draw 2 mL total into a 3 mL syringe
- Inject into 100 mL NS bag
- Draw up 10 mL from mixture in 10 mL syringe for administration
- Final concentration 0.4 units/ml
- They use an initial dose of 1-2 units

initial bolus 2-4 units
- 4u in ==haemorrhagic shock== as physiological replacement, restoring AVP level from 0 to normal
	- endogenous reserve from the posterior pituitary can be depleted after 30-40 minutes
