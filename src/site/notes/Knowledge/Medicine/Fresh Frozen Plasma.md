# Fresh Frozen Plasma

usual dose 15-20ml/kg
1ml FFP : 1u [[pages/Prothrombin Complex Concentrate\|PCC]]

Plasma quality assessed based on F8 activity (∵ least stable (next being F5))
(Standard: FFP must contain ≥0.7IU/ml F8 in at least 75% of units after thawing)

In the case of a coagulation factor deficiency, frozen plasma transfusions will increase the levels of the coagulation factors, but the effect on the INR and aPTT depending on two factors: 
- the amount of frozen plasma transfused
- degree of the coagulopathy.

Given the concentration of 1 unit/mL for individual coagulation factor levels in frozen plasma, transfusing four units of frozen plasma (approximately 800–1000 mLs) to a 70 kg patient with a 5-liter blood volume, would be expected to increase levels by a maximum of 16%
