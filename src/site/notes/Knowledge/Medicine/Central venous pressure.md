The “Monere” sign (Latin word for warning) is a sign of early right ventricular dysfunction. It occurs when the “V” wave is higher than the “A” wave and the “Y” descent equal or deeper than the “X” descent

The “Tombstone” sign indicates right heart failure. It occurs when no “X” descent is present and only a “V” is seen
