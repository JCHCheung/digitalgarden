# DOAC
Perioperative bleeding risk does not appear to differ among DOAC medications

predictable PK & PD

peak effects occurring 2 to 3 hours after DOAC intake


**Elimination half-lives** of factor Xa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, andedoxaban) are ==8 - 12h== in patients with a CrCl above 30mL/min.

Dabigatran
- higher dependence on kidney clearance
- Elimination half life
	- CrCl >50ml/min → 10 - 14h
	- CrCl 30-49.9ml/min → 18 - 24h

because the typical length of DOAC cessation perioperatively is short (eg, 2-4 days), the risk of thromboembolism associated with DOAC cessation in the perioperative period is low (eg, <0.5%)

DOACs are not recommended for use in pregnant or breastfeeding individuals becausetheycrosstheplacentaandarepresentinbreast milkandthere are insufficient data about their safety for the fetus andnewborn
