# Transposition of great arteries
most ==common cyanotic== cardiac lesion in newborns, accounting for 5-10% of all [[pages/congenital heart disease\|CHD]].

# Anatomy & physiology
Discordant ventriculoarterial connection
![](https://i.imgur.com/80C9uN7.png)

AV valve follows the ventricle
## d-TGA
d = dextro looping pattern
- situs solitus of atria
- concordant AV connection
- a/w VSD in 40%
- LVOTO in 5-10%

In contrast to the normal subpulmonary infundibulum, there is a subaortic conus, and fibrous continuity is present between the pulmonary and mitral valves, unlike in the normal heart where an aortic-mitral curtain is found.

The term ‘simple’ transposition refers to the malformation in which the ventricular septum is intact or nearly intact in the presence of a small VSD and the LVOT is not obstructed.

Other structural anomalies/variants that are associated with TGA include pulmonary valve stenosis, obstruction to the RV outflow tract (RVOT), aortic stenosis, aortic arch obstruction, atrioventricular valve abnormalities, variations in coronary artery pattern, persistent left superior vena cava, and juxtaposed atrial appendages.

Physiology = parallel circulation
incompatible w/ life unless intercirculatory shunting exists (e.g. PFO, ductus arteriosus)

similar physiology to double outlet RV w/ subpulmonary VSD (Taussig-Bing malformation)

temporising measure:
- balloon atrial septostomy
- prostaglandin E1 → maintaing ductal patency

Dextro vs meso vs levocardia

presentation: RV failure
regurgitation of systemic TV

### Hint in Echo
RV hypertrophied
"LV" no papillary muscles & moderator band present
systemic AV valve trileaflet

## Atrial switch operation
The atrial baffle procedures (Mustard and Senning operations) reroute the systemic venous return to the LV and the pulmonary venous return to the RV, thus allowing for physiologic correction in transposition

Most adult patients are likely to have undergone this type of repair. Long-term problems related to these interventions led to the evolution of the surgical approach for this lesion


## Arterial switch operation
The arterial switch operation (ASO) is the ==current preferred surgical strategy== for patients with TGA.

This single-stage procedure is performed in the first few weeks of life and involves 
- transecting both arterial roots above their respective sinuses,
- switching the great arteries to restore the normal ventriculoarterial connections,
- translocating the coronary vessels to the ‘neoaortic’ root.
Outcomes after the operation are generally excellent.

## Rastelli operation
The concomitant presence of a ==VSD== and pulmonary stenosis/LVOT obstruction in the setting of TGA requires alternative surgical management strategies

Rastelli procedure involves creating an ==intracardiac patch== or tunnel that reroutes the LV output through the aorta while closing the interventricular communication, and placing an ==extracardiac tube== or conduit between the RV and PA

## Post-atrial switch
assess venous baffles for obstruction or leaks
- baffle flow (by doppler) 
	- should be pulsatile
	- always return to baseline
	- often <1.5m/s
identification of intracardiac shunting

## Post-ASO:
AV & semilunar valves for regurg
interrogation of outflow tracts (aortic & PA anastomoses) & branch PAs to exclude obstruction
residual shunts
