# Double lumen tube
Adv:
- quicker to insert
- less prone to displacement
- can accommodate the deflation & suctioning of secretions from either lung

# Features & design
Modern DLTs are single use, made of polyvinylchloride and are based on the Robertshaw design

DLT sizes are sized using the French (Fr) gauge system, where 1 Fr=1/3 mm of the outer diameter. Thus, a 37 Fr DLT has an outer diameter of 1/3×37=12.3 mm.

- Correct bronchus
	- Clamp tracheal lumen
	- ventilate bronchial lumen
	- → should ventilate ==left== lung
		- if ==right== lung ventilates → DLT in RMB
- Correct depth
	- Clamp bronchial lumen
	- ventilate tracheal lumen
	- → ==right== lung ==easily== ventilated
		- if ==↑Paw==: tracheal lumen obstructed by wall of LMB
			- → need shift out
		- if ==both== lungs ventilate → too far out
			- → need shift in
- Bronchoscopy
