# Subarachnoid haemorrhage

aSAH accounts for only 2â€“5% of all strokes, and global incidence declined from 10.2 per 100,000 person-years in 1980 to 6.1 in 2010, with significant variabilities across regions, age, and sex

The global decrease in aSAH incidence paralleled a global reduction in prevalence of hypertension and smoking

Although the prognosis of aSAH has improved over the last decades, 12% of patients die before reaching the hospital, and the 90-day case-fatality of patients hospitalized for aSAH is approximately 30%
