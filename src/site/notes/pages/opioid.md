## Opioids induced hyperalgesia vs tolerance
Frequently confused but often co-exist
Both manifest clinically as need for ↑opioid dose to achieve same analgesic effect
- tolerance → give ↑ dose
- OIH → avoid opioids, & use other [[analgesics\|analgesics]] or adjuncts
	- ↑ opioid → ↑ pain

Dose-effect relationship: Tolerance shifts to ==right== (but dose not alter pain sensitivity). OIH shifts ==down== ∵ ↑pain sensitivity

### OIH
Definition: a state of paradoxically ↑ response to noxious stimuli, presumably as a result of nociceptive sensitisation, caused by an exposure to opioids

### Possible mechanisms
predominance of pronociceptive mechanisms e.g. activation of [[NMDA\|NMDA]] system
on > off-neurons w/i ==rostro-ventral medulla==
- descending spinal facilitation
- mediated via [[NMDA\|NMDA]] system
- exposure to prolonged noxious stimuli induced "on" state
- µ opioid receptor ligand → "off" state
↑ [[dynorphin\|dynorphin]] in spinal cord & primary afferents after noxious stimuli activate release of [[calcitonin gene related peptide\|calcitonin gene related peptide]]

#### Cellular mechanisms
remifen

### Opioid tolerance
