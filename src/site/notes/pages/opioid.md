## Opioids induced hyperalgesia vs tolerance
Frequently confused but often co-exist
Both manifest clinically as need for ↑opioid dose to achieve same analgesic effect
- tolerance → give ↑ dose
- OIH → avoid opioids, & use other [[analgesics\|analgesics]] or adjuncts
	- ↑ opioid → ↑ pain

Dose-effect relationship: Tolerance shifts to ==right== (but dose not alter pain sensitivity). OIH shifts ==down== ∵ ↑pain sensitivity

### OIH
also read: [[pages/Remifentanil#Remifentanil induced hyperalgesia\|Remifentanil#Remifentanil induced hyperalgesia]]
Definition: a state of paradoxically ↑ response to noxious stimuli, presumably as a result of nociceptive sensitisation, caused by an exposure to opioids

a "normal adaptive response" counteracting perturbations from exogenous opioids?

a/w nearly all types of opioids, w/ dose-dependent hypersensitivity e.g.
- morphine-6 glucuronide
- [[methadone\|methadone]]
- phenanthrene-based class opioids
- synthetic opioids-piperidines
- NOT w/ [[oxymorphone\|oxymorphone]]

OIH incidence & degree of hyperalgesia ∝ opioid ==dose== & exposure ==duration==
#### Possible mechanisms
predominance of pronociceptive mechanisms e.g. activation of [[NMDA\|NMDA]] system
on > off-neurons w/i ==rostro-ventral medulla==
- descending spinal facilitation
- mediated via [[NMDA\|NMDA]] system
- exposure to prolonged noxious stimuli induced "on" state
- µ opioid receptor ligand → "off" state
↑ [[dynorphin\|dynorphin]] in spinal cord & primary afferents after noxious stimuli activate release of [[calcitonin gene related peptide\|calcitonin gene related peptide]]

[[pages/Remifentanil\|Remifentanil]]: activates peripheral & spinal neurons differently, which presumably results in hyperalgesia developing at different time point (early vs late) during post-infusion period.

#### Prevention & treatment
##### General
↓ opioid dose & gradual dose tapering
NMDA antagonists
- ketamine
	- 5 µg/kg/min infusion effective for [[pages/Remifentanil\|Remifentanil]]
- dextromethorphan
[[pages/Buprenorphine\|Buprenorphine]] 
- κ-receptor agonism
- δ-receptor downregulation
- 25 µg/h for 24h for RIH
COX-2 inhibitor
- [[Parecoxib\|Parecoxib]]
	- effective w/ early treatment 30min before application of remi
	- concomitant administration ineffective?
α2 agonists - [[Dexmedetomidine\|Dexmedetomidine]]
[[methadone\|methadone]]
[[MgSO4\|MgSO4]]
##### RIH
Gradual taper of [[pages/Remifentanil\|Remifentanil]] infusion rate (vs abrupt stop)
addition of [[Propofol\|Propofol]] to [[pages/Remifentanil\|Remifentanil]] may ↓OIH
- ? ∵ inhibitory effects on [[NMDA\|NMDA]] receptors
- effect on supraspinal [[GABA\|GABA]]-A receptors
- even sub-hypnotic dose may help


### Opioid tolerance
