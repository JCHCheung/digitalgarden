# aortic dissection

In untreated acute type A aortic dissection, the rate of mortality within in the first 48 h is greater than 50% and emergency open surgery is generally indicated

progression of acute type B dissection is often uncomplicated and the generally accepted first line treatment for this consists of medical therapy. In complicated acute type B dissection, however, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the established treatment
# Non-A non-B aortic dissection
In 1994 von Segesser proposed the term the non-A non-B dissection for dissections in which an intima tear is localized beyond the ascending aorta. In these forms, the dissection is limited to the ==aortic arch== or can be described as a ==retrograde dissection== arising from the descending aorta that extends into the arch and stops before the ascending aorta

When the dissection is limited to the aortic arch or can be described as a retrograde dissection arising from the descending aorta that extends into the arch and stops before the ascending aorta; these dissections are then termed as non-A non-B aortic dissections

non-A and non-B dissection patients tend to be younger and have a lower mortality compared to type A dissection patients

A tear in the intimal layer tends to arise in locations where the rise in blood pressure is the greatest, commonly 2–2.5 cm above the aortic root
