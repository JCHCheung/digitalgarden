# Cardiac disease in pregnancy

[[pages/Peripartum cardiomyopathy\|PPCM]]

There are currently multiple risk stratification tools for cardiac disease in pregnancy including the modified World Health Organization (mWHO) Classification of CVD in Pregnancy, Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy Study (CARPREG II), and Zwangerschap bij Aangeboren HARtAfwijkingen (ZAHARA) tools

The mWHO classification is a validated, lesion-specific risk stratification tool that divides different cardiac lesions into five groups based on risk of cardiac events. The mWHO classification facilitates planning with its framework which can be used to determine resources required by subgroup

The CARPREG II score incorporates features such as coronary artery disease which are not included in the mWHO classification in its risk stratification

Referral for consultation with the obstetric anesthesiology team in the ==second trimester== is ideal; the anesthesia team can evaluate maternal tolerance of pregnancy physiology to date and anticipate anesthetic requirements for labor and delivery

# MOD
In general, vaginal delivery is preferred due to less blood loss, inflammatory response, hemodynamic instability, chance of air or thrombotic embolism, and lower risk of infection than cesarean delivery (CD) which is a major abdominal surgical procedure

When people have cardiac lesions that preclude the ==Valsalva maneuver== such as severe aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, or aortopathy, instrumental vaginal delivery may help avoid CD; however, the associated risks of [[pages/Postpartum haemorrhage\|PPH]] and severe perineal lacerations must be anticipated

Cardiac indications for CD include ==cardiopulmonary instability== without time or ability for optimization with medical management, and high risk ==aortopathy==

# MOA
==Epidural== and combined spinal epidural (CSE) analgesics and anesthetics are favorable for patients with CVD because they can be slowly titrated to provide adequate analgesia and/or anesthesia while maintaining hemodynamic stability

==Early== epidural placement during labor facilitates hemodynamic stability by attenuating the catecholamine response to labor and provides the preferred method of anesthesia – conversion of labor epidural to anesthetic - if intrapartum CD is needed

## Monitoring
Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring may be warranted for patients with mWHO Class III-IV or equivalent lesions and can be used for mWHO Class I-II lesions if there is decompensation or other significant obstetric or general comorbidities

## Haemorrhage Mx
[[Oxytocin\|Oxytocin]], commonly administered after delivery for active management of the third stage of labor, has cardiovascular effects including:
- ↓ SVR,
- ↓ inotropy,
- ↓ chronotropy

To mitigate these effects in patients with or without CVD, oxytocin is usually administered as a slow bolus and/or infusion

[[Carboprost\|Carboprost]] is a prostaglandin that is used as a second line uterotonic for hemorrhage and is contraindicated in patients with pulmonary disease because of the risk of ==bronchospasm==

Methylergonovine is an ergot alkaloid that is another second line uterotonic agent, and its use is contraindicated in patients with hypertension
