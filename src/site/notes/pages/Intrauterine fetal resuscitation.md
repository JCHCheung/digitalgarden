# Intrauterine fetal resuscitation
Intrauterine resuscitation (IUR) involves measures to ==improve oxygen delivery to the placenta== and subsequent ==transfer to the distressed fetus== in an attempt to reverse hypoxia and normalise the fetal pH.

These interventions may improve the fetal condition and allow for normal delivery or improve fetal well-being before an emergency operative delivery, ==giving time== for an epidural top-up or spinal anaesthetic to become effective, thereby ==avoiding the need for general anaesthesia==

# Fetal distress

Mechanism of fetal hypoxia:
- Maternal
	- hypoxia
	- hypotension
	- anaemia
	- metabolic acidosis
- Uterine
	- hyperstimulation
	- uterine rupture
- Placental
	- premature separation
	- abruption
	- vascular degeneration
	- infarction
- Cord
	- cord prolapse
	- nucha cord
	- cord knotting
- Fetal
	- infection
	- malformation
	- anaemia
	- haemorrhage

‘==Fetal distress==' refers to a suspicious ==fetal heart trace== with or without evidence of acidosis from a fetal blood sample

Persistent fetal distress can lead to a ‘progressive fetal asphyxia state’.

When fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns are abnormal or variable, EFM has a ==high sensitivity== (the ability to detect a healthy fetus when a fetus is truly healthy), but a ==low specificity== (the ability to detect a compromised fetus while excluding healthy pregnancies from the criteria).

Acute deterioration in FHR pattern can be produced by ==reversible== factors (e.g. increased uterine activity or poor maternal positioning) as well as ==irreversible== factors (e.g. placental abruption, maternal haemorrhage, cord prolapse or uterine rupture).

Ultimately fetal wellbeing is dependent on ==maternal, placental, and fetal== factors.

## Maternal factors
In addition to ==uterine perfusion pressure== (arterial pressure − venous pressure), placental blood flow is affected by ==resistance== to blood flow. Uterine perfusion pressure is affected in pregnancy as aortocaval compression is significant during the third trimester
During late pregnancy, ==uterine spiral arteries== are maximally relaxed and placental oxygen delivery is close to maximum.

Active contractions during labour raise intrauterine pressure to 50 mmHg, compressing the veins at first and increasing the volume of intervillous blood until intrauterine pressure is high enough to block blood flow to the uterus

There is a subsequent fall in fetal oxygen saturation by about 7% at about 90–120 seconds following a peak contraction, indicating a decline in blood oxygenation in the intervillous space. After contractions, oxygenation recovers at a similar pace. When oxygenation is impaired there may be a significant reduction in oxygen saturations causing fetal bradycardia. Oxygenation is unlikely to recover between contractions if it has been severely compromised.

To allow sufficient oxygen diffusion through maternal–fetal membranes in the intervillous gap, the maternal ==haemoglobin== level must be above ==10 g/dL== and the ==oxygen saturation== should be sustained above ==95%==.

Hypovolaemia or hypotension can cause blood volume to be shunted away from the gravid uterus, reducing fetal oxygen supply. ==Lack of autoregulation== will lead to a linear decrease in uterine blood flow with maternal blood pressure.
### Aortocaval compression
Aortocaval compression (ACC) is usually ==asymptomatic== due to ==sympathetic compensation== such as peripheral vasoconstriction which promotes the development of collaterals for venous return
(normal compensation disrupted by [[Knowledge/Medicine/Neuraxial block\|Neuraxial block]])

==10%== of parturients may be unable to compensate and suffer from the ==‘supine hypotension syndrome’==

During IUR the mother should be placed in the ==full lateral position== to maximise blood pressure and uteroplacental blood flow
## Placental factor
It is a ==passive== process transferring oxygen (from placenta to fetus) along a gradient from a high maternal PO2 of 100 mmHg to a low fetal PO2 of 35 mmHg. Since fetal ==haematocrit== is higher and fetal haemoglobin has a stronger ==affinity== for oxygen, the increase in fetal oxygen concentration and FSpO2 during maternal oxygen treatment is steeper

## Fetal factors
Umbilical venous oxygen saturation levels are 30–35 mmHg at term, while the fetal haemoglobin saturation is 75–80% due to several factors including a high fetal haematocrit (17–19 g/dL), a high fetal cardiac index (350 mL/m2/min) as well as the presence of haemoglobin F which helps to warrant adequate fetal oxygen content.

If the cord is caught by the presenting part or wrapped around the fetal head or shoulder during labour, it might be ==compressed== intermittently. Variable decelerations on the FHR may result

In cases of ==complete cord occlusion==, oxygenated blood cannot be delivered to the fetus via the umbilical vein, necessitating immediate operative delivery. To restore blood flow through the cord, the compression can be relieved directly (by manually elevating the presenting part) or indirectly (by filling the bladder with saline or by assuming a modified Trendelenburg or knee-chest position).

The FHR is the key component in predicting cardiac output as stroke volume is relatively constant.

Increasing maternal intravascular volume with ==fluid== boluses can increase uterine blood flow and placental perfusion by augmenting cardiac output, reducing blood viscosity and having a ==short-term tocolytic== impact

Fluid infusion improves the fetal condition even when there are no symptoms of maternal hypotension. It is recommended that rapid IV crystalloid infusions with lactated Ringer's solution be given when a fetus is in distress; ==1000 mL== has been shown to improve outcomes more than 500 mL, and the effects last well after infusion

In contrary to phenylephrine, ==ephedrine== crosses the placenta, increases FHR, and directly affects the fetal metabolic status (evidenced by the reduced umbilical arterial pH). The advantages of increasing FHR are expected to exceed the unfavourable metabolic effects of ephedrine in the event of fetal bradycardia because fetal cardiac output relies on FHR.
