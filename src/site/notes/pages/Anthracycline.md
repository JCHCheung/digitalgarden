# Anthracycline
doxorubicin
daunorubicin
epirubicin
idarubicin

Since their introduction in the 1960s, anthracyclines have been a significant breakthrough in oncology, introducing dramatic changes in the treatment of solid and hematologic malignancies

# Cardiotoxicity

In clinical practice, the application of anthracyclines is limited by a dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, leading to both systolic and diastolic cardiac dysfunction and, in less common cases, overt heart failure

Anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity can be categorized based on the ==temporal== relationship to drug administration

==Acute== cardiotoxicity may develop anytime during or shortly after the anthracycline treatment and is generally ==reversible== upon drug discontinuation; it is ==rare==, occurring in <1% of cases

==Early onset== cardiotoxicity can appear within the ==first year== after treatment, which is often associated with an ==asymptomatic decline== in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); this form represents ==98%== of the total cardiotoxicity cases in a large cohort of anthracycline-treated patients

==Late onset== cardiotoxicity, which becomes clinically evident ==more than 1 year== after exposure, typically presents as ==hypokinetic== and/or ==dilated cardiomyopathy== with ==overt HF symptoms==.

Despite efforts to reduce cumulative doses in the treatment of cancer, the use of ==liposomal== formulations, and the omission of anthracyclines from chemotherapy regimens, many cancer patients are still treated with these drugs, which increases their risk of cardiac dysfunction.

# Pathophysiology
The molecular mechanisms of anthracycline cardiotoxicity can be broadly divided into 3 main areas:
- oxidative stress,
- alterations of cell death pathways,
- epigenetic changes
## Oxidative stress
anthracyclines both generate ==reactive oxygen species== (ROS) and mobilize ==iron==, which facilitates the iron-catalyzed free radical deterioration of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum

This damage may lead to dysregulation of energy metabolism and calcium homeostasis
## Alteration of cell death pathway
anthracyclines are known to induce ==myocyte apoptosis== through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways

anthracyclines ==dysregulate autophagy==, resulting in the accumulation of undegraded autophagosomes and autolysosomes. This accumulation eventually leads to death rather than allowing for the physiological degradation and recycling of cellular components
## Epigenetic change
Anthracyclines can ==down-regulate DNA methylation==, which results in altered mitochondrial gene expression, and ==up-regulate histone deacetylation==, leading to deacetylation of proteins such as α-tubulin

anthracyclines can both up-regulate and down-regulate numerous microRNAs, although the downstream consequences of these changes are only partially understood

2 pharmacokinetic determinants of cardiotoxicity rest on more solid evidence: the ==cumulative dose== of anthracyclines and the extent of their ==accumulation in cardiac tissue

Anthracyclines are ==incompletely cleared== from cardiomyocytes, leading to a cardiac pool that increases with each infusion and begins to induce cardiotoxicity

Morphologic and functional damage eventually occur when the cumulative dose causes the size of these cardiac anthracycline pools to exceed the detoxifying capacity of cardiomyocyte

Low cumulative doses and small anthracycline pools still induce cardiotoxicity if genetic variants, comorbidities, cardiac RT, or concomitant administration of other potentially cardiotoxic drugs magnify cardiac vulnerability

==Liposomal== doxorubicin formulations, because of their size, do not easily diffuse through the regular endothelium of coronary vessels, resulting in reduced delivery of anthracycline to cardiomyocytes

==slow or prolonged== infusions generate plasma anthracycline levels too low to promote significant anthracycline accumulation in cardiac tissue, yet ==tumors== remain highly ==sensitive== to continued anthracycline exposure


# Definition of cardiac dysfunction

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Decrease in LVEF of >10% from baseline to LVEF <53%  <br>Relative drop in GLS >15% from baseline | Decrease in LVEF of >10% from baseline to LVEF <50%  <br>Relative decrease in GLS of >15% from baseline | LVEF drop by ≥10%-15% or LVEF <50%  <br>HF symptoms regardless of LVEF |

Variability in defining anthracycline cardiotoxicity limits precise determinations of its incidence, progression, and prognostic value.

The definition of CTRCD, endorsed by multiple societies, now integrates LVEF and ==GLS== decrements as well as ==troponin== elevations and new onset HF symptoms.

# Diagnosis / imaging

==GLS== <16% or a relative modification >15% from baseline are considered risk markers, indicating the potential need to start cardioprotective drugs before LVEF decrements eventually occur.

==Diastolic dysfunction== (DD) can occur in patients undergoing treatment with anthracyclines

limited but persuasive evidence suggests that the ==right ventricle== is also prone to anthracycline damage

==CMR== can detect microvascular obstruction, tissue iron overload, and diffuse interstitial fibrosis (via native T1 mapping and calculation of the extracellular volume fraction), whereas myocardial edema can be quantified via T2 mapping

In clinical practice, CMR is mainly used for evaluating LVEF when echocardiography is limited by a poor acoustic window or provides borderline values or when a clinical suspicion of myocarditis requires diagnostic refinement
# Cardioprotection
The optimal cardioprotective strategy for patients undergoing anthracycline therapy is yet to be clearly defined

Neurohormonal blockade is recommended for preventing CTRCD in patients who receive high-dose anthracyclines (≥250 mg/m2) and/or those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. ==Statins== may be beneficial for lymphoma patients scheduled for high-dose anthracyclines.

# Treatment
CTRCD can be reversible if detected early and treated appropriately.

ESC guidelines on cardio-oncology recommend managing CTRCD according to current HF recommendations.
