# Viscoelastic haemostatic assay

# ROTEM
Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM, TEM International, Munich, Germany) utilizes a fixed cuvette and a rotating pin to initiate clotting

The ROTEM sigma device is fully automated, while the delta device requires trained operators to pipette blood samples

The ==EXTEM== test activates the ==extrinsic== pathway using ==tissue thromboplastin== with the clot time (CT) reflecting the time taken for clot formation to begin, and therefore the velocity of thrombin generation

The amplitude of the EXTEM trace is dependent on both platelets and fibrinogen and is reported at 5 and 10 minutes, as well as at maximum firmness

The addition of ==cytochalasin D==, a potent platelet inhibitor, to the ==FIBTEM== test isolates the contribution of fibrinogen to clot strength

The ==INTEM== test utilizes ==ellagic acid== and ==phospholipids== to initiate clot formation and reflects the ==intrinsic== pathway

The ==APTEM== assay incorporates a ==plasmin inhibitor== to allow evaluation of ==fibrinolytic== activity

# TEG
The manually operated ==TEG 5000== initiates clot formation with an oscillating cup around pin

automated ==TEG6S== device utilizes pre-filled cartridges and a resonance technique, vibrating the sample and measuring clot formation with an LED system

==Tissue factor== and ==kaolin== stimulate the ==intrinsic== and ==extrinsic== pathway in the Rapid TEG assay with the kaolin assay alone reflecting the intrinsic pathway

The addition of ==abciximab== (a platelet inhibitor) allows isolation of ==fibrinogen== contribution to clot strength
