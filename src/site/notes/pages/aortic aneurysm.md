# aortic aneurysm
A ==true aneurysm== of the aorta is a ==permanent== dilatation at least ==50%== greater than its original size involving ==all wall layers==

A ==pseudoaneurysm== is a rupture through the layers of the aorta held together by blood and surrounding tissues

A dissection is a disruption of the intimal layer of the aorta, with bleeding within the wall.

Untreated aneurysms of the descending and thoracoabdominal aorta exceeding ==6 cm== in diameter have a 14.1% annual rate of rupture, dissection, or death.
The 5 yr survival of patients managed conservatively is 10–20%

Indications:
- rupture or acute dissection
- symptomatic enlargement: pain or compression of adjacent structures
- aneurysm enlargement >1 cm/y or rapid increase in size
- absolute size >6.5 cm or >6.0 cm in patients with connective tissue disease

Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) are described using the ==Crawford== classification according to the location of aneurysmal sections
- Extent I: 
	- from ==left subclavian== artery
	- to ==below diaphragm==
- Extent II: 
	- from ==left subclavian== artery
	- to ==aortic bifurcation==
- Extent III: 
	- from the ==lower half== of ==descending thoracic== aorta
	- extending to the aortic ==bifurcation==
- Extent IV: disease confined to the ==abdominal== aorta

Pre-op assessment
- functional capacity & organ system reserve
	- risk stratification
- evidence of compression of adjacent structures e.g.
	- stridor / dyspnoea from encroachment onto trachea / LMB
	- dysphagia from oesophageal compression
	- HOV from RLN stretching
- baseline neuro deficits
Pre-op Ix:
- PFT
	- may need [[pages/One lung ventilation & lung isolation\|OLV]]
- CAD
- CPET
- CT
	- look for compression

# Surgery involving aortic arch
## DHCA
Repair of the aortic arch involves ==interruption== to the cerebral blood supply necessitating the use of CPB with ==deep hypothermic circulatory arrest== (DHCA). Cerebral perfusion may be maintained antegrade via cannulation of arteries as they branch from the aortic arch or via the arterial line into the right axillary, subclavian, or innominate artery, or retrograde via cannulation of the internal jugular vein.

Hypothermia is an effective technique for the protection of the central nervous system and other viscera in the presence of reduced or absent blood flow. The lower temperature ==reduces tissue metabolic activity== and attenuates the ==inflammatory== response to ==reperfusion==.
The core temperature is allowed to decrease spontaneously with additional cooling from the heater/cooler on the CPB circuit. Application of topical cooling to the head is performed in some centres to minimise passive warming, although the benefits of this have been extrapolated from studies in animals. Where used, particular care should be taken to protect the patient's eyes

Opinions vary on the degree of hypothermia required. Deep hypothermia (14.1–20°C) allows 20–30 min of safe circulatory arrest time compared with 10–20 min where moderate hypothermia (20.1–28°C) is used

Profound cooling contributes to morbidity through the development of ==coagulopathy== and an increased ==inflammatory== response.

## Anaes considerations
Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring via the right radial artery ensures continued assessment should the aortic cross-clamp be applied proximal to the left subclavian artery. 
If the right axillary artery is used for antegrade cerebral perfusion, a left radial arterial catheter may be required

Temperatures measured within the ==nasopharynx== have been shown to most accurately reflect cerebral temperature, and monitoring is usually via probes positioned in the nasopharynx and either rectum or bladder

==Pharmacological protection== of the brain and spinal cord is used variably as an adjunct to hypothermia, as there is little consistent evidence. Drugs occasionally administered include thiopental, methylprednisolone, magnesium, and lidocaine.

==Near-infrared spectroscopy== is increasingly used during surgery involving the aortic arch to provide continuous, real-time non-invasive monitoring of anterior cerebral oxygenation. The proportion of light absorbed attributable to oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin within the cerebral cortex is calculated using adhesive diodes on the forehead. Intracerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) is calculated and should be maintained within ==25% of baseline==. 
Inadequate cerebral perfusion should prompt assessment of cannulation sites; increased flow rate within the CPB circuit; optimised haemoglobin concentration; and, if necessary, increased hypothermia and Pco2 to promote vasodilatation.

# Surgery involving descending aorta
Where a clamp can be placed distal to the left subclavian artery and there is to be no interruption to the cerebral blood supply, the use of partial left heart bypass (PLHB) is preferable

## Anaes considerations
OLV
neuromonitoring

A left-sided DLT is used for ease of positioning, although external compression of the left main bronchus by the enlarged aorta may preclude this, and a right-sided DLT or single-lumen tube with bronchial blocker may be required

An arterial catheter is sited in a femoral artery, in addition to the right radial artery, to allow monitoring of distal perfusion pressure

A central venous catheter and percutaneous introducer sheath are inserted into the left internal jugular vein; insertion into the right may lead to problems with kinking once the patient is positioned

# Spinal cord protection
Paraplegia after thoracic aortic surgery is a devastating and life-limiting complication, reported to occur in 4–16% of cases overall and in up to 50% of Extent II aneurysms

Perfusion insufficiency may be 2/2
- ↓ segmental arterial inflow during and after surgery
- ↑ tissue pressure ∵
	- oedema
	- ↑ CSF pressure,
- ↑ venous pressure limiting outflow

[[pages/Aortic cross clamping\|Aortic cross clamping]] 
- ↓ arterial blood flow
- ↑ [[Knowledge/Medicine/Central venous pressure\|central venous pressure]]
→ compromising spinal cord perfusion

Replacement of diseased sections of aorta requires temporary or permanent interruption of arterial collaterals, leading to spinal cord ischaemia and subsequent reperfusion injury.
Ischaemia causes spinal oedema, hyperaemia, and inflammation, thus increasing the CSF pressure (CSFP) and compromising spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP).

Risk factors for spinal cord ischaemia include
- extent of the aneurysm; 
- longer duration of aortic cross-clamping;
- requirement for emergency surgery
- ; previous surgery to the distal aorta;
- severe peripheral vascular and atherosclerotic disease;
- perioperative hypotension;
- advanced age; 
- diabetes mellitus

interventions to ↓ risk of spinal cord ischaemia, including
- minimising cross-clamping time
- sequential clamping of the aorta 
- reimplantation of intercostal & lumbar segmental vessels
	- (for open repair only)
- drainage of CSF to maintain SCPP,
- use of neurophysiological monitoring

Monitoring may be
- functional 
	- SSEP
	- motor-evoked potentials
- metabolic
	- CSF analysis
- physiological
	- lumbar CSF pressure 
	- paravertebral muscle oximetry
- clinical (post-op)
	- LL motor & sensory
	- bowel & bladder continence
## Spinal cord blood supply
The ==superior== source vessels are branches from the left ==subclavian== and ==vertebral== arteries, which form the ==anterior== and ==posterior spinal arteries==.
Throughout its length the anterior spinal arteries receive supply from the paired intercostal and lumbar segmental arteries and then caudally from branches of the inferior ==mesenteric==, ==internal iliac==, and ==sacral== arteries

reverse flow from spinal arteries may both contribute to ==extraprosthetic leaks== after the placement of sealed or occlusive stent grafts (type II endoleaks) and ‘shunt’ blood from the spinal circulation by a low-resistance pathway
## [[Knowledge/Part 2/Vascular/Lumbar drain\|Lumbar drain]]
Cerebrospinal fluid drainage is effective because acute changes in the spinal cord in response to ischaemia or reperfusion may result in oedema and increased CSF pressures during the procedure and for ==48–72 h== (or even longer) afterwards

CSFP is maintained at ==10–15 mm Hg==
CSF is drained to maintain this at rates up to ==20 ml/h==
Monitoring of CSFP and drainage continue for up to ==72 h== after surgery.

An SCPP target of ==70 mm Hg== is used in most centres, requiring a CSFP of less than 15 mm Hg and a minimum MAP of 80 mm Hg
Where there is evidence of spinal cord ischaemia, the SCPP and MAP target can be increased in 5 mm Hg increments

The spinal drain consists of a transduced intrathecal catheter inserted at the level of L3–4 or L4–5 to reduce the risk of direct spinal cord damage

## [[Knowledge/Part 2/NS/Intra-op neuro-monitoring\|IONM]]
Paraplegia caused by spinal cord ischaemia significantly dampens the lower-limb potentials when compared to those of the upper limb.
MEPs disappear in the presence of neuromuscular blocking agents, and volatile anaesthetics also cause dose-dependent depression of the MEP at doses within the range used in clinical practice

TIVA is preferred if MEPs are to be used

SSEPs, although less frequently used, allow monitoring of the posterior ascending sensory columns, and are not affected by neuromuscular blocking agents or volatile anaesthetic agents.

A ↓ in MEP amplitude >50% should prompt reinsertion of intercostal arteries into the graft along with measures to improve spinal cord perfusion.
A MAP >80 mm Hg and distal aortic pressure >60 mm Hg are targeted.
Haemoglobin concentration should be maintained at or above 100 g/L
CSF may be drained at 20 ml/h
The decision for surgical intervention is usually made within 3–5 min of the change in the neurophysiological variables.
