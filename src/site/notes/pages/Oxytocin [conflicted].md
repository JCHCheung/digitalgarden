# Oxytocin
[[pages/Uterotonics\|Uterotonics]]
Commercially a/v oxytocin contains the preservative ==chlorbutol== = negative inotrope

# Structure and mechanism of action
Oxytocin is an ==endogenous neuropeptide== hormone, with a nonapeptide structure, released by the posterior pituitary gland.
It exerts its main effects on uterine smooth muscle to cause ==contraction== in labour and on the mammary glands to cause ==lactation==

Oxytocin exerts its uterine effects by stimulation of oxytocin receptors in the ==myometrium==. This causes direct myometrial contraction via ==phospholipase C== activation and ==inositol triphosphate== release, leading to the release of ==intracellular calcium==. 
It also stimulates the production of prostaglandin ==PGF2α== and ==PGE2== in the ==endometrium==, which help to initiate labour

# Oxytocin receptor
The oxytocin receptor is a ==G-protein-coupled== receptor. These receptors are known to exhibit receptor ==downregulation== within a ==short time frame== of exposure to the receptor agonist.
The receptors undergo rapid ==internalisation== from the cell membrane due to this homologous stimulation.
This phenomenon has been demonstrated with the oxytocin receptor, in both in vitro and in vivo studies, in relation to endogenous as well as exogenously administered oxytocin

There is a ==decrease in the expression== of oxytocin receptor messenger RNA (==mRNA==) and the ==binding sites== of oxytocin, leading to ==reduced myometrial cell response== and ==reduced contractions==. The time frame within which this occurs may be relatively short

The majority of this research was undertaken by Balki and colleagues in Canada, who demonstrated that oxytocin receptor ==desensitisation== occurs in both a ==concentration== and ==time-dependent== manner. As a result of this, oxytocin dose requirements in clinical practice vary depending on prior exposure.

# Administration and pharmacokinetics
Synthetic oxytocin first came about in the 1950s and has since been exogenously administered for labour induction and labour augmentation, as well as for the prophylaxis and management of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) in both vaginal and caesarean deliveries

The drug is stored in the fridge at a temperature of 2–8 °C and has a mean ==half-life of distribution of 2 min== and an ==elimination half-life of 12 min==

Both the liver and kidneys are involved in its rapid elimination, with very little being excreted in the urine
to further metabolise oxytocin, the ==placenta== produces the enzyme ==oxytocinase== which is released into the plasma, levels of which increase in pregnancy and peak at term. This enzyme metabolises both endogenous and synthetic oxytocin, therefore bolus doses need to be followed up with ==intravenous infusions== to maintain the desired uterine contractile effects

# C/I and SE
Cardiovascular

Oxytocin causes
- transient hypotension,
- reflex tachycardia
- ↑ CO

Such changes are known to occur in fit and healthy women and are more ==prominent== with ==rapid== intravenous boluses

In healthy women undergoing CD, electrocardiography changes of ==ST depression== and ==T-wave inversion== were commonly seen. However, these effects were not attributed to the oxytocin bolus, but rather the ==sympathetic block== of SA, surgery, pregnancy or delivery

The main absolute contraindication to oxytocin is true allergy. 
Relative contraindications relate to its negative cardiovascular side effects, however modifications to the dosing regime allow it to be used even in women with severe cardiovascular disease.

==Slower== administration of oxytocin, co-administered with intravenous boluses or infusions of phenylephrine has been shown to mitigate the negative haemodynamic effects

Patients with [[pages/Preeclampsia\|preeclampsia]] and cardiac disease are at heightened risk for ==unpredictable== and potentially severe cardiovascular and haemodynamic responses to oxytocin, mediated possibly by an ==inability to ↑ SV== in the setting of diastolic dysfunction

Other side effects of oxytocin include
- nausea,
- vomiting,
- headache
- flushing.
As a result of structural similarities with [[Knowledge/Medicine/Vasopressin\|vasopressin]], large doses of oxytocin may cause
- water retention
- [[hypoNa\|hypoNa]] 
- seizures and coma
however, the antidiuretic effects may be minimised with an ==infusion== rate of less than 45 mIU/min
in patients at higher risk of pulmonary oedema, such as those with severe cardiac conditions or preeclampsia, a ==lower rate== of oxytocin infusions should be utilised
