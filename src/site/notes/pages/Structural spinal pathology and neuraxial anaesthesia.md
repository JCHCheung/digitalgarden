# Structural spinal pathology and neuraxial anaesthesia

When assessing the feasibility of and approach to neuraxial analgesia in a patient with abnormal spinal anatomy, several key factors should be considered:
1. Are ==anatomical landmarks== abnormal or missing, and does a specific vertebral level need to be avoided?
2. Does the patient have an ==intact ligamentum flavum== and will a loss-of-resistance technique be feasible?
3. Is there tissue, such as scar tissue, bone graft or surgical spinal implants in the path of the needle that could ==preclude needle insertion== or be damaged by needle or catheter insertion?
4. Is there significant ==disruption to the epidural space== that would preclude local anaesthesia spread or catheter insertion?

## Mechanical LBP
Low back pain may accompany radicular pain with associated motor and sensory deficits, which should be examined and clearly documented. Back pain accompanied by red flag symptoms such as saddle anaesthesia, major motor weakness, incontinence and fevers should prompt further investigation.

## Disc disease & spinal stenosis
In recent years, some evidence has emerged to suggest that there may be an increased risk of new or worsening neurological impairment in patients with existing spinal stenosis when neuraxial anaesthesia is used

This may be related to a compressive–ischaemic effect because of reduced cross-sectional area of the vertebral canal, direct trauma, haematoma, or enhanced neurotoxic effects of local anaesthetics resulting from limited distribution in the smaller space.

→ these data are almost entirely derived from ==older, non-obstetric== patients, with very few cases reported in parturients

no firm linkage to injury if spinal stenosis is at a site distant from the level of neuraxial block placement, and if possible, the neuraxial block can be performed at an alternative level to the one affected by disc herniation or stenosis.

## [[pages/Scoliosis\|Scoliosis]]
Scoliosis is defined as a ≥10° lateral curvature of the spine in the standing position on a coronal radiographic image

idiopathic scoliosis is the most common aetiology with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) encompassing 80% of cases

Operative management is indicated when progressive scoliosis exceeds ==45°== in patients with an immature skeleton or when progression or pain occurs after skeletal maturity.

### Uncorrected scoliosis
The epidural injectate has been shown to initially flow towards the concave side of the curve in approximately 80% of cases. As such analgesia may be unilateral and higher volumes may be required.

### Corrected scoliosis
In ==anterior== fusion, the vertebral column is accessed anteriorly with screw and rod placement lateral to the vertebral bodies. The spinous processes remain intact and no bone graft or scar tissue should be present posteriorly to inhibit needle placement. Neuraxial analgesia in these patients should be straightforward.

==Posterior== fusion entails the placement of multiple bilateral pedicle screws, hooks or both, followed by rod insertion and compression/distraction of the convex and concave aspects of the curve. Spinal osteotomies may be required for release before compression/distraction, and the procedure is completed with placement of extensive bone graft to encourage fusion of the involved segments. As a result, access to the neuroaxis in the region of the fusion may be impossible

distraction/compression, bone grafting and spinal osteotomies may cause epidural space distortion and fibrosis, which may affect catheter passage and spread of local anaesthetic.

Epidural catheterisation may be challenging in women who have had posterior fusion, with catheter placement taking longer and failed or repeated attempts being more common than in healthy controls. Reassuringly, despite these difficulties, successful analgesia in this group has been reported in up to 88% of cases.

In corrected scoliosis, neuraxial analgesia below the level of instrumentation is an option and the use of ultrasound for vertebral level localisation is recommended. Common inadequacies in analgesia such as unilateral or patchy block may be overcome through repositioning and additional doses of local anaesthetic as required. In the event of epidural failure, primary or repeat spinal anaesthesia may be a rescue option with or without the use of a spinal catheter.

## Previous spinal surgery
Scar tissue-mediated distortion of anatomical landmarks and epidural fibrosis may be an issue for neuraxial anaesthesia in these patients

if the ligamentum flavum has been resected, a loss-of-resistance technique at the surgical level will not be reliable

## Spinal dysraphism
Spinal dysraphisms are broadly divided into open and closed abnormalities. Open spinal dysraphisms are characterised by exposure of the nervous tissue, the meninges or both to the environment through a congenital bony defect. Closed spinal dysraphisms are covered by skin such that there is no exposure of the neural/meningeal tissues, although there may be overlying cutaneous stigmata such as skin dimples or hypertrichosis.

The underlying spinal cord and associated structures are abnormal; there may be low-lying or tethered spinal cord and conus medullaris, split cord or lipomata.

Sensory impairment is extremely variable and may be asymmetric or demonstrate perineal sparing. 

Coexistent scoliosis and Chiari malformation with hydrocephalus may be present

Such patients also may have severe [[latex allergy\|latex allergy]]

posterior spinal cord ==tethering== may be present, even in the context of prior detethering at the time of surgery, leaving it vulnerable to needle trauma

A posterior tethered cord with intact sensation is considered an ==absolute contraindication== to neuraxial anaesthesia for this reason

Women with a sensory level above T10 may not require labour analgesia, although anaesthesia above T4 is required for Caesarean delivery

Autonomic dysreflexia is rare in this population as the majority of lesions occur in the lumbosacral region. In those with a sensory level above T6, consideration should be given to provision of anaesthesia to avoid provoking autonomic dysreflexia
## PDPH
Image-guided epidural blood patch has been described in postspinal surgery patients with complex anatomy and may be an effective and safe option
