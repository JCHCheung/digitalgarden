# Intrauterine fetal death
Late intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) is defined as ==fetal death in utero== after ==24== completed weeks of pregnancy of a singleton fetus

Stillbirth is defined as a baby delivered with no signs of life known to have died after 24 completed weeks of pregnancy

Causes
- maternal
- fetal

Complications:
- maternal DIC
- sepsis
- emotional

## Obs Mx
Urgent delivery of the fetus if there is sepsis, preeclampsia, abruption or membrane rupture.

Aim to manage in a quiet room separate from the other labour ward activities to reduce stress and anxiety as well as allowing the family access to support the mother.

# Analgesia for labour
An epidural technique is the most effective form of analgesia and can also be offered to the patient in the absence of significant ==sepsis or coagulopathy==.

The risk of ==coagulopathy== should be assessed before performing neuraxial blocks. A normal coagulation profile ==within 6 h== of a neuraxial block is considered acceptable

The risk is very low ==within 3 weeks== of an IUFD (unless associated with abruption, PET or uterine rupture). Check if any thromboprophylaxis has been given (or planned) and time the insertion of the neuraxial block accordingly
