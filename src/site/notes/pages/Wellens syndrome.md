# Wellens syndrome

- Pattern of T-wave abnormality in mid precordial leads (V2-V3, +/- V4)
- No loss of R-waves in precordial leads
- Highly specific for critical obstruction of the proximal LAD
- High risk for extensive anterior wall MI and death

- Type 1 – Deeply symmetric TWI
- Type 2 – Biphasic T waves with terminal TWI. Goes up first, then down (often misdiagnosed as “normal” or “non-specific T-wave abnormality”). Often misdiagnosed as “non-specific T-wave pattern” or “normal”.

- ST changes are often absent and patient can be in a chest pain free state!
- Cardiac biomarkers often initially normal
- Best to diagnose in absence of high voltage
- Not currently a guideline indication for cath or lytics (especially when pain free without STE) but…
- Medical management usually ineffective and patients are best treated with PCI, treadmill stress testing may be hazardous and precipitate acute MI.
- Patients will have anterior wall MI unless they get early PCI. 75% developed acute MI within weeks when only medically managed.
- Get serial ECG’s, as some of these do evolve into STEMI in the ED
- Watch carefully for Wellens’ as some of your consultants may not know about this.

## DDx
normal variant ST elevation & TWI
- Young males, especially athletes
- Typically of African-Caribbean descent
