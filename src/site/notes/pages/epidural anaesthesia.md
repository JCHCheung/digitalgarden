# EA

## Sitting vs lateral
Benefits of lateral position
- ↓ patient movement
- feasible even in cord prolapse / fetal presenting part
- ↓ blood in needle / catheter in lateral or lateral Trendelenberg
	- even in ↑ BMI
	- → ↓ overall attempts
	- (Behar M, et al. CJA 2001)
	- ∵ ↓ venous engorgement
		- ∵ valveless system
		- (Igarashi et al. Anesthesiology 2000)
	- ↑ patient comfort
		- ∝ BMI?

## identify the space
↑ accuracy w/ USG

### Nocebo-induced hyperalgesia during LA injection
→ use kind words

## Paramedian vs midline
- less reliant on flexion
- greater anatomic tolerance
- avoid supraspinous & interspinous ligaments
- ? ↓PDPH w/ paramedian
	- force of CSF pressing on the membranes forming a "valve"
	- some difference btw point of entry of dura vs arachnoid
		- → no direct tract
- ↓ wet tap
	- ↑ distance btw LOR to dura
	- less likely to puncture dura ∵ angle not perpendicular
- easier to thread catheter
	- ∵ cephalad directing
- can travel through epidural space further
	- catheter stays cephalad & midline

(Boon - 2004; 5 = ligamentum flavum, 6 = epidural space, 7 = dura matar)

## Bevel direction
### Bevel facing cephalad
- ↓ one sided block
- ↓ inadequate block
- ↑ parturient comfort

Bevel facing to one side may ↑ unilateral block → useful in e.g. orthopaedics
## LOR
LOR first described 1921 (Sicard & Forestier)

air vs NS: no difference in
- unblocked segments
- incomplete analgesia
- PDPH

avoid LOR to air if
- epidural blood patch
- R to L shunt ∵ risk of air embolism
### Air Cx
- pneumocephalus
- venous air emboli
- subcut emphysema


| CSF     | saline |
| ------- | ------ |
| warm    | cold   |
| pH > 8  | pH < 7 |
| glucose | -      |
| protein | -      |
→ Need all 4 to differentiate
(add a drop of thiopentone → CSF turn turbid)
## Test dose
problems w/ adrenaline
- ↓ effect ∵ ↑ Vd
- effect masked by contraction
- RIsks
	- ↑ BP could be harmful
		- gestational HT
		- PET
	- may ↓ uterine blood flow
problems w/ lignocaine
- need ==at least 100mg== to reliable distinguish intravascular injection
conc. LA impairs ambulation for at least 60min

## Saline prior to catheter
↓ blood in catheter (evidence w/ older nylon catheter)
? ↓benefit w/ new (= softer) catheters

## Securing the catheter
catheter naturally moves w/ soft tissue
→ allow to change posture before taping

but 7cm inside ↑ unilateral block

## Initial dosing
↓ conc of LA w/ ↑ volume
- ↑ pain relief
- ↑ motor block
- ↑ duration
## Epidural opioid
↓ LA dose
↓ motor block → ↓ instrumental delivery
↑ maternal satisfaction
### epidural fentanyl
- bolus : segmental (spinal)
- infusion : non-segmental (supraspinal) analgesia
- 100mcg = dose threshold for effect
- 3x potency: epidural vs IV
## Patchy / unilateral block

### Reasons for failed block
- [[pages/Plica mediana dorsalis\|Plica mediana dorsalis]] in epidural space could lead to asymmetric block

?top up before shift out

## Failure of EA / labour neuraxial analgesia
definition varies & unclear e.g.
- lack of analgesia after 45min
- accidental dural puncture
- need of replacing epidural catheter or abandoning the technique
- maternal dissatisfaction at FU visit
### Risk factors
#### Patient factor
- high BMI
- landmark not visible / palpable
- Hx of previous failure
- poor patient cooperation
- longer labours
	- ? from migration
- pre-procedural pain
- breakthrough pain
- poor communication
- ? high fetal head station & oxytocin use
	- ∵ ↑ pelvic resistance for fetal head → ↑ pain
#### Procedure related factors
- non-obs anaesthetists
- epidural catheter design
	- mono-orificial catheter
	- catheter stiffness
- chosen method of LOR
### Conversion failure (of EA for C section)
defined as
- need for GA
- conversion to another type of anaes (including SA)

major factors:
- ↑ number of top-up during labour
- ↑ urgency of CS
- non-obs anaesthetists

Conversion failure implies other risks:
- high spinal
	- typically recommended to wait for a lapse of ==30min== before SA
- GA
- [[Knowledge/Medicine/Difficult airway\|Difficult airway]]
## lignocaine
- more likely to cause tachyphylaxis & neurotoxicity
- NOT recommended for labour analgesia
- 1st choice for top-up or for emergency CS
