# Respiratory noises

wheeze vs stertor vs stridor

## Wheeze
Wheezing is typified as a ==coarse whistling== sound heard on the phase of ==expiration== and is usually due to lung disease

## Stertor
Stertor is a ==grunting== or a ==snoring== sound and is loudest during ==inspiration==

## Stridor
The ==high-pitched== noise of stridor can occur during the respiratory phase of inspiration, expiration, or both (biphasic). 

==Inspiratory== stridor is caused by airway obstruction at the ==vocal cords or higher==.

Biphasic stridor is caused by obstruction ==below the vocal cords==. The most common cause of biphasic stridor in children is viral croup.

==Expiratory== stridor is caused by obstruction in the ==trachea==. The most common cause of expiratory stridor in children is tracheomalacia.
