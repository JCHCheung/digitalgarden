# Anti-rheumatic drugs

Evidence on peri-op use is in general low
(level of evidence often *low* in guidelines)

SLE often considered separately from other rheumatological diseases

**Severe** SLE: 
currently treated (induction or maintenance) for severe organ manifestations: 
- lupus nephritis, 
- CNS lupus, 
- severe hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin <9.9 gm/dl), 
- platelets <50,000, 
- vasculitis (other than mild cutaneous vasculitis), including:
	- pulmonary hemorrhage, 
	- myocarditis, 
	- lupus pneumonitis, 
	- severe myositis 
		- (with muscle weakness, not just high enzymes), 
	- lupus enteritis (vasculitis),
- lupus pancreatitis, 
- cholecystitis, 
- lupus hepatitis, 
- protein-losing enteropathy, 
- malabsorption, 
- orbital inflammation/myositis, 
- severe keratitis, 
- posterior severe uveitis/retinal vasculitis, 
- severe scleritis, 
- optic neuritis, 
- anterior ischemic optic neuropathy

¶ For patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, or all SLE for whom antirheumatic therapy was withheld prior to undergoing total joint arthroplasty, antirheumatic therapy should be restarted once the wound shows evidence of healing, any sutures/staples are out, there is no significant swelling, erythema, or drainage, and there is no ongoing nonsurgical site infection, which is typically ~14 days.

# Steroid
ACR suggests ==continuing the current daily dose== of steroids in patients scheduled for surgery rather than administering glucocorticoids on the day of surgery. If patients require **high doses** of glucocorticoids, it implies indirectly that ==disease activity is not controlled==, and for better outcomes, elective surgery needs to be postponed. Hydrocortisone can be considered in these patients if refractory hypotension occurs; however, the recommendations are irrelevant for patients with primary adrenal insufficiency

BSR reinstates that steroid exposure should be minimised prior to surgical procedures and that an increase in steroid dose to prevent adrenal insufficiency is not routinely required
