# Congenital heart disease
## Background
around 1% of all live births having CHD
up to 90% surviving into adulthood
30% of CHD patients have non-cardiac congenital anomalies

# Classification
- [[pages/congenital heart disease#By structure\|#By structure]]
- [[pages/congenital heart disease#By physiology\|#By physiology]]
## By structure
- [[pages/congenital heart disease#normal = ‘in ==series==’\|Normal]]
- [[pages/congenital heart disease#balanced = ‘in ==parallel==’\|Balanced]]
- [[pages/congenital heart disease#completed single ventricular circulation\|#completed single ventricular circulation]]
### normal = ‘in ==series==’
- ==predominant== path of blood flow follows that of a structurally ==normal== heart

Examples
- small septal defects, w/ simple shunts
- surgically corrected CHD
### balanced = ‘in ==parallel==’
Large cardiac defects lead to mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood, and consequently a parallel or ‘balanced’ circulation

Flow to the systemic and pulmonary vasculature depends upon the ==relative resistances== (i.e. the balance) of PVR vs SVR. Excessive blood flow to one area compromises blood flow to the other.

Chronic hypoxia can lead to abnormal clotting and hyperviscosity

Table 1. Factors affecting pulmonary blood flow

| Factors ↓ pulmonary blood flow                                                                 | Factors ↑ pulmonary blood flow                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### completed single ventricular circulation
When patients are born with a hypoplastic ventricle, surgery is palliative and leads to a single ventricular circulation. This is usually a three-stage process

Hypoplastic left heart anatomy showing features of 
- a hypoplastic left ventricle (LV)
- hypoplastic aortic arch (Ao)
- an atrial septal defect (ASD)
![](https://i.imgur.com/9o5EU4t.png)
#### Stage 1: ==Norwood== procedure: 
- atrial septostomy, 
- anastomosis of ==Ao== → ==PA==
	- → 'neo-aorta'
- formation of a modified Blalock–Taussig ==shunt== (mBTS) 
	- Sano modification
		- RV-PA conduit
		- + PDA ligation
	- to supply pulmonary blood flow
For illustrative purposes, both mBTS and Sano shunt are included in this diagram.
![](https://i.imgur.com/YRadR8T.png)
#### Stage 2: ==Glenn shunt== / bidirectional Glenn / Hemi-Fontan: 
at age 3-5mo
- mBTS or Sano shunt is ligated
- anastomosis of ==SVC== → right ==PA==
- post-op remains cyanosed
	- Sat 75-85%
![](https://i.imgur.com/LoPb5lp.png)
#### Stage 3: ==Fontan== procedure / total ==cavopulmonary== circulation (TCPC): 
age 3-5y
- completing the ==separation== of systemic & pulmonary circulations
	- ==IVC + SVC== connected to ==right PA==
		- pulmonary blood flows passively
		- pressure gradient affected by PVR & intrathoracic pressure
			- ∴ Avoiding ↑ PVR + optimizing ventilation strategies important
		- fenestration can be created to decompress high pulmonary venous pressure
	- systemic circulation pumped by a ==single ventricle==
Shown here is an extracardiac conduit, the current favoured technique.

Although spontaneous ventilation increases blood flow through the lungs, positive pressure ventilation may allow better control of oxygenation and minute volume

If controlled ventilation is necessary, pulmonary blood flow can be optimized by 
- ↓ peak insp time
- ↓ peak insp pressure
- ↓ PEEP
## By physiology
by the ==shunt== and ==direction of flow==.
- **==L to R== shunt** (simple)
	- ↑ pulmonary blood flow
	- e.g.
		- [[atrial septal defect\|atrial septal defect]]
		- [[ventricular septal defect\|ventricular septal defect]]
		- AVSD
		- [[patent ductus arteriosus\|patent ductus arteriosus]]
- **==R to L== shunt** (simple)
	- ↓ pulmonary blood flow
	- cyanosis
	- e.g.
		- [[Tetralogy of Fallot\|Tetralogy of Fallot]]
		- [[pulmonary atresia\|pulmonary atresia]]
		- tricuspid atresia
		- [[Ebstein's anomaly\|Ebstein's anomaly]]
- ==complex== shunts
	- mixed pulmonary / systemic blood flow
	- cyanosis
		- e.g.
			- transposition of great arteries
			- truncus arteriosus
			- total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage
			- double outlet right ventricle
			- hypoplastic left heart syndrome
			- large septal defects
- ==obstructive== lesions
	- high pressure gradients
		- e.g.
			- coarctation of aorta
			- interrupted aortic arch
			- aortic stenosis
			- pulmonary stenosis
In some complex cases of CHD, such as complex shunts and obstructive lesions, oxygenation is dependent on a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to allow mixing of pulmonary and systemic circulations. Neonatal patients are often on prostaglandin therapy to keep the duct open, therefore any prostaglandin inhibitors, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are contraindicated.

Patients with low-risk features, may be appropriate to be managed in a local hospital, those with intermediate and high-risk features require tertiary referral

## Compensated vs compromised - Big 4
### 1) Heart failure
- very high risk
	- 10% arrest
	- 96% inotrope requirement
- s/s
	- tachpnoea
	- tachycardia
	- diaphoresis
	- failure to thrive
### 2) [[pages/Pulmonary hypertension\|Pulmonary hypertension]]
- PAP >25mmHg at rest
- PAP >30mmHg on exercise
- chest infection poorly tolerated
### 3) [[pages/arrhythmia\|arrhythmia]]
- ==[[RBBB\|RBBB]]== common on pre-op [[Knowledge/Medicine/ECG\|ECG]]
- ==ventricular ectopics== could be ominous sign
	- esp in pt w/ univentricular circulations
### 4) cyanosis
- usually w/ concomitant heart failure / [[pages/Pulmonary hypertension\|PHTN]] / [[pages/arrhythmia\|arrhythmia]]
- often ==polycythaemic==
	- ↑ risk of cerebral vein & sinus ==thrombosis==
- often ==young== (<5yo)
- abnormal ==coagulation== profiles
	- PT, APTT
	- platelet dysfunction 
	- ↓ factor concentrations
## History
resting ==SpO2==
assess need x premed
==non-cardiac== anomalies
- e.g. risk of bradycardia on [[sevoflurane\|sevoflurane]] induction in [[Knowledge/Part 2/Paed/Down's syndrome\|trisomy 21]]
==chest infection== → delay OT
Details of previous intensive care admissions should be obtained, as a period of ==prolonged ventilation== ↑ risk of ==tracheal stenosis== & ==difficult intubation==
A history of DIVA may be an indication for an inhalational induction.
### Drug Hx
- ACEi
	- ↑ likelihood of hypotension on induction
	- often withheld on morning of surgery
- Aspirin: 
	- low-dose aspirin is often continued
- [[pages/Pulmonary hypertension\|PHTN]] therapy: 
	- if the degree of [[pages/Pulmonary hypertension\|PHTN]] requires treatment → likely need specialist involvement
## Exam
look for signs of ==heart failure==
## Ix
#### Echo
- pressure gradients across valves
- obstructive lesions
- PAP
- RV & LV function
#### ECG
look for [[pages/arrhythmia\|arrhythmia]]
#### CXR
- chest infection
- cardiomegaly
- pulmonary oedema
#### Bloods:
- ↑ HCT if cyanotic
- check urea & lytes if on diuretics
## Risk stratification + tertiary referral
children stratified as ‘low risk’ may have a similar risk of death as children without CHD

| Feature                          | Associated perioperative complication | Referral trigger                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[pages/Pulmonary hypertension\|PHTN]] | 8 x risk of major complication        | Receiving treatment                                               |
| Cyanosis                         | Cerebral and sinus vein thrombosis    | Presence of high-risk factors                                     |
| [[pages/arrhythmia\|arrhythmia]]                   | [[pages/Cardiac arrest\|Cardiac arrest]]                    | Ventricular ectopics  <br>Single ventricle circulation            |
| Type of surgery                  | Mortality risk 16% for major surgery  | Intraperitoneal, intrathoracic or vascular reconstructive surgery |
| Cardiac failure                  | Cardiac arrest: 10% risk              | Severe, symptomatic                                               |
## Conduct of anaesthesia
### Pre-op
Clear instructions on ==fasting==
- ∵ important to avoid dehydration
	- especially if cyanotic
##### Premed
- neither psychologically or physiologically desirable for children with CHD to be stressed
	- → lower threshold for premed
- e.g. midazolam 0.5 mg/kg 20–30 minutes prior to induction
### Induction
if DIVA / inhalational induction → preferable to have 2nd experienced anaes
#### Inhalational induction
- possible w/ [[sevoflurane\|sevoflurane]]
	- should be ==slow== w/ lower concentrations
	- avoid prolonged inspiration of 8% sevoflurane
		- ∵ ↓ SVR & coronary perfusion
	- caution w/ [[Knowledge/Part 2/Paed/Down's syndrome\|trisomy 21]]
		- ∵ risk of bradyarrhythmias.
#### IV induction
Propofol reduces SVR and mean arterial pressure
ketamine has less effect on these variables
### Maintenance
volatile or IV
### Analgesia
opioid commonly used
neuraxial: need vasopressor to counteract ↓SVR
## Peri-op complications
==Sudden== complications
- arrhythmias / ectopics
- bleeding
	- esp patient on anticoagulation
- [[pages/Cardiac arrest\|cardiac arrest]]
	- high risk features a/w peri-op arrest
		- [[cardiomyopathy\|cardiomyopathy]]
		- cardiac failure
		- balanced or single circulation
		- arrhythmias
- ==hypoxia==
	- DDx of unexpected intra-op hypoxia
		-  pulmonary hypertensive crisis
		- ==reversal of shunt==
		- ↓ SVR
		- ↑ PVR
Complications relate to ==heart function==
- cardiomyopathy
- poorly functioning Fontan
- ventricular failure requiring transplant
### [[infective endocarditis\|infective endocarditis]] prophylaxis
Patients with structural congenital heart disease, including surgically corrected or palliated structural conditions are at increased risk of infective endocarditis. 
However, NICE no longer recommends prophylactic antibiotics for gastrointestinal, genitourinary and dental procedures. 
Instead, the emphasis is on education regarding ==good oral hygiene== and ==symptoms== of infective endocarditis.
### Pacemakers / defibrillators
#### Pacemaker
- type of device
- reason for insertion
- backup mode
- response to diathermy
- consider [[Knowledge/Medicine/Arterial line\|A line]]
#### ICD
- disable before induction
- external defibrillator pads applied
	- remote from the ICD
Pacemakers & ICDs should be checked + reactivated in theatre recovery.
