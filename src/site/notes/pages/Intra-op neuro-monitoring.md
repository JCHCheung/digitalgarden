# Intra-op neuro-monitoring

If the resection area involves or is adjacent to the somatosensory or motor cortex then monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) may be required. A ==TIVA== technique is preferable in this case to minimise interference with monitoring

If MEPs are monitored then the muscles of mastication will be activated. A reinforced tracheal tube should be used, and care must be taken to place an appropriately sized ==bite block== between the molars ensuring that the tongue and cheeks are free.
