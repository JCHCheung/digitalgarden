# Orthognathic surgery
shared airway
need to check occlusion of teeth intra-op
## Bleeding
Minimizing blood loss intra-operatively can be difficult, especially during maxillary surgery

The bony mid-face receives an extensive blood supply and the posterior maxilla is also in close proximity to a rich venous plexus. Bleeding can therefore be heavy from both soft tissue and bone. 
Surgical haemostasis is hampered by limited access and the ease with which the surgical field is rapidly obscured by blood. Identification of vessels traversing bone can be difficult both before and after osteotomy. 
Bleeding can occur from branches of the third part of the maxillary artery and on occasions from the pterygoid venous plexus which can lead to major blood loss.

Techniques used to minimize bleeding and improve the surgical field include 
- positioning the patient head up, 
- ensuring there is no impediment to venous drainage, 
- induced-hypotension 
- infiltration of large doses of epinephrine-containing local anaesthetic solutions

‘Dental’ anaesthetic solutions contain higher concentrations of epinephrine (1:80 000) than used in other types of surgery, and patients who are typically young, fit and healthy may show a marked increase in heart rate and sometimes arterial pressure after their use. Unless expected, these may easily be mistaken for signs of light anaesthesia. 

Usage should be limited to a maximum of ==300 µg/h of epinephrine==

## Airway
In the event of nasal intubation proving impossible, there are three alternatives. In ==retromolar== intubation, an attempt is made to pass a reinforced oral TT (inserted conventionally) behind the most posterior molars, thus still allowing the teeth to be brought into occlusion. With ==submental== intubation, the end of the conventionally inserted oral TT is passed (minus its connector) through the floor of the mouth and out percutaneously. Neither of these is ideal from the surgical perspective and the risk of accidental TT dislodgement is high. ==Tracheotomy== is theoretically another option.

In the event of damage to the TT between the pilot-balloon and cuff, oropharyngeal packing may sometimes be enough to compensate for a small leak of air from the deflated cuff where tube exchange would otherwise be very difficult

Throat packs are used routinely in many (but not all) centres. They reduce the amount of blood entering the stomach, offer some degree of protection from bony debris, and aid the stability and security of the TT

## Analgesia
Mandibular and maxillary nerve blocks performed by the surgeons can be utilized to aid postoperative pain relief. Furthermore, they also have the potential to reduce the stress response to surgery, reduce fluctuations in heart rate and arterial pressure and reduce the dose requirements of hypotensive agents

## PONV
Intra-operative steroids, usually dexamethasone, are administered primarily to minimize postoperative swelling but are also efficacious anti-emetics and contribute to analgesia.

## Induced hypotension
There is some level-one evidence that induced-hypotension can reduce blood loss, transfusion rate, and operating time associated with orthognathic surgery9 but this is all controversial

The making of osteotomy cuts in the maxilla is usually associated with the most bleeding directly whereas other stages of surgery such as ‘down-fracture’ of the maxilla (Fig. 1) may be more stimulating and indirectly make haemostasis challenging. Unfortunately, the ‘down-fracture’ usually has to be completed before blood loss can be fully controlled.

During induced-hypotension, mean arterial pressure should be reduced by ==no more than 30%== of the patient’s normal with an absolute lower limit of ==55mmHg== (in ASA I patients).
