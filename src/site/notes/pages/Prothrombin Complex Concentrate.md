# Prothrombin Complex Concentrate
1u PCC : 1ml [[Knowledge/Medicine/Fresh Frozen Plasma\|FFP]]

Hemostasis is based on the potential of the blood to produce thrombin (thrombin generation) and the downstream effects of thrombin on coagulation, anticoagulation, fibrinolysis, and the vascular endothelium

According to the ==cell-based concept== of coagulation, hemostasis begins with the initiation phase, which is characterized by the involvement of ==tissue factors== and ==phospholipids== and leads to the initial production of small amounts of thrombin

The production of thrombin activates platelets, factor V, and factor VIII and leads to the second phase (==propagation== phase) of coagulation.
In this phase, thrombin production increases rapidly and forms a hemostatic plug. 
Hemostasis concludes with the ==termination== phase, in which various inhibitory mechanisms regulate the amount and duration of thrombin production and prevent excessive clot formation

Thrombin generation is most sensitive to prothrombin levels (increased thrombin generation) and antithrombin levels (decreased thrombin generation) but can also be perturbed by hemodilution, coagulation factor consumption, shock-induced systemic acidosis, and hypothermia

Patients with severe trauma and coagulopathy often present with reduced levels of ==factors V, VII, and X and fibrinogen== early after injury

==Hemostatic resuscitation== approaches to restoring thrombin generation in trauma vary with massive bleeding and focus on [[Knowledge/Medicine/Fresh Frozen Plasma\|fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) to replace ==soluble coagulation factor== deficiency and restore hemostasis. However, in vitro and clinical studies suggest inefficient thrombin generation recovery after FFP transfusion alone

==no significant differences== in morbidity or mortality were observed with ==higher FFP ratios== in cases of severe trauma and major bleeding

Benefits of plasma
- blood volume expansion
- glycocalyx protection

first-line treatment with four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC), as part of a coagulation factor concentrate-based hemostatic approach guided by viscoelastic point-of-care (POC) coagulation monitoring to reversing TIC, rapidly restores ==clot strength== and reduces the need for ==allogeneic blood products==

One ==advantage== of 4F-PCC over FFP is its ability to deliver ==high doses== of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors to restore hemostasis ==more effectively and faster==

Other adv:
- in austere environments w/ limited access to blood products
- ?higher biologic safety ∵ viral pathogen inactivation
- some formulations can be stored at room temp
Con:
- limited evidence
- no consensus on indications / timing / dosage regimes / adjunct transfusion therapies
- ?risk of thromboembolism
- differences btwn commercially a/v PCC
	- composition
		- additives
			- heparin
			- antithrombin
	- functional activity
The study highlights the importance of treating each PCC as a ==distinct agent==, with individualized safety and efficacy profiles, and advises caution when substituting products

# Pharmacology
The coagulation activity (measured in IU/ml) of lyophilized 4F-PCC is based on ==factor IX== content, although the concentrations of other factors vary between products, as well as other anticoagulant proteins such as protein C, protein S, and variable amounts of heparin (0.2 to 0.5 IU per IU of factor IX), antithrombin III, and human albumin, which are not therapeutic

==Three-factor== prothrombin complex concentrate (3F-PCC; e.g., Profilnine SD, Grifols Biologicals Inc., USA) contains factors ==II, IX, and X== and a relatively low concentration of factor VII (less than or equal to 175 IU per 500 IU PCC)

4F-PCC, includes a high concentration of ==factor VII== (180 to 500 IU per 500 IU PCC),  affecting the ==extrinsic, tissue-factor induced== coagulation pathway.
4F-PCC also contains antithrombotic proteins C and S, small amounts of heparin (0.2 to 0.5 IU per IU factor IX), antithrombin III, and human albumin

In healthy individuals, ==factor II== (prothrombin) exhibits an elimination half-life of ==60 h==. The other procoagulant factors have a half-life of approximately ==40 h==, whereas the ==antithrombotic== proteins are eliminated in greater than ==50 h==

==rapid administration== of 4F-PCC, combined with the ==prolonged half-life== of prothrombin and the imbalance of pro- and anticoagulant proteins, raised concerns about ==thromboembolic== complications

# Anticoagulant reversal
==Low-dose== 4F-PCC (==25 IU/kg==) has been proposed as a cost-effective alternative to high-dose 4F-PCC (50 IU/kg) for the acute reversal of factor Xa inhibitors, providing effective hemostasis without increasing the risk of thromboembolic events or in-hospital mortality
# Use in major trauma
the use of 4F-PCC is indicated for severe bleeding events in which impaired thrombin generation is confirmed by the loss and/or consumption of coagulation factors, as identified through conventional coagulation analysis or viscoelastic testing

4F-PCC is ==not== recommended as a first-line empirical treatment, except in cases of exsanguination or very rapid massive bleeding, where rapid replenishment of coagulation factors, along with volume replacement and erythrocyte transfusion, is the primary objective

It is crucial to consider the patient’s comorbidities, which may increase the risk of ==thromboembolic== events, and to individualize dosing to avoid overdosage.

[[Andexanet alfa\|Andexanet alfa]], although associated with higher thrombotic risk, has shown superiority in cases of intracranial hemorrhage.

[STS/SCA/AmSECT/SABM Update to the Clinical Practice Guidelines on Patient Blood Management - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8220901/)
Prothrombin concentrate is reasonable to consider over FFP as first-line therapy for refractory coagulopathy in cardiac surgery in select situations to reduce bleeding
