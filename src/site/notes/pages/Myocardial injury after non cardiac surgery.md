# Myocardial injury after non cardiac surgery
Up to 20% of adult patients have a postoperative elevated troponin after noncardiac surgery

Whether presenting with or without clinical symptoms, troponin elevation after noncardiac surgery has been shown to be independently associated with elevated risk of mortality, and cardiovascular complications for over a year after surgery

mortality is similar in symptomatic patients meeting the formal criteria for a diagnosis of myocardial infarction and in patients without any clinical symptoms

The American Heart Association lately defined MINS by ==at least one== postoperative cTn concentration that exceeds the 99th percentile upper reference limit of the cTn assay
Troponin elevation should be due to a ==presumed ischemic mechanism== (i.e., supply–demand mismatch or atherothrombosis), that is in the absence of overt nonischemic etiologies. Therefore, MINS does not include perioperative myocardial injury due to nonischemic causes such as sepsis, rapid atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, or renal failure; nor does it include chronically elevated troponin concentrations

Based on the formal diagnostic criteria of MINS, postoperative MI represents a subset of MINS. 

Specific troponin assay thresholds for the diagnosis of MINS are:
- any elevation ≥30 ng/l for Troponin 4th generation (TnT)
- For high sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT)
	- ≥20 to <65 ng/l w/ an absolute change of ≥5 ng/l
	- any elevation ≥65 ng/l
	- any absolute change ≥14 ng/l.

# Early landmark studies
Vision Phase 1
- International prospective cohort study
- Primary aim: determining the prognostic importance of postoperative troponin elevation
- Systematically troponin measurements at 6–12 h after surgery and on the first three postoperative days while patients remained hospitalized
- 15 133 patients involved, 4th-generation troponin T (nonhigh-sensitivity) was measured
- 8% of patients met MINS criteria
- Patients with MINS had an overall mortality at 30 days of 9.8% compared to 1.1% in patients without MINS
- Population-attributable risk for death was 34% (95% CI: 27, 4)
- Importantly, the vast majority (84%) of patients remained asymptomatic and only 42% of the patients fulfilled the formal criteria for MI

Vision Phase 2
- 21,842 patients had high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) measured in the second phase
- Elevated postoperative hsTnT (i.e., 20 to <65 ng/l with an absolute change ≥5 ng/l compared to baseline, or hsTnT ≥65 ng/l) deemed to be ischemic in nature was associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted HR, 3.20; 95% CI, 2.37–4.32)
- 18% of patients had MINS, according to a definition of MINS based on these criteria for hsTnT elevation

The ==MANAGE== trial is the first and only trial testing a pharmacological intervention specifically in patients with MINS
- 1754 patients 
- 45 years old or older who underwent noncardiac surgery in 84 hospitals in 19 countries 
- randomized within 35 days of MINS
- receive oral dabigatran 110 mg BID or placebo
- primary efficacy outcome 
	- (i.e. a composite of vascular mortality and nonfatal MI, nonhemorrhagic stroke, peripheral arterial thrombosis, amputation, and symptomatic venous thromboembolism) 
	- 11% in the dabigatran and 15% in the placebo groups,
		- over a mean follow-up of 16 months after surgery 
		- (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55–0.93)
Thus, the MANAGE trial confirmed that patients with MINS have a ==poor long-term prognosis== and established the efficacy and safety of a possible intervention for secondary major cardiovascular complications in these patients
# Epidemiology & pathophysiology
More than 90% of MINS occurs during the initial 48 h after noncardiac surgery: 
- roughly 40% on POD0 
- 40% on POD1
- 15% on POD2

baseline CV risks

? Supply-demand mismatch > atherothrombotic event

Several ==intraoperative== triggers of MINS have been identified:
- hemodynamic disturbances
	- (perioperative hypotension and hypertension), 
- tachycardia,
- anemia, 
- hypothermia <35.5 °C,
- postoperative pain
# Prevention
There is currently no known safe and effective method for prevention of perioperative MI and MINS, despite three large scale randomized trials investigating four separate preoperative interventions including
- beta-blockers (POISE),
- nitrous oxide (Enigma-2),
- aspirin, and clonidine (POISE-2)

> [!NOTE] POISE
> Perioperative Ischemic Evaluation Study (POISE) randomized 8351 patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease to extended-release ==metoprolol== or placebo for inpatient noncardiac surgery, started 2–4 h before surgery and continued for 30 days after surgery. Metoprolol ==prevented nonfatal MI==, with 152 (3.6%) patients given metoprolol having infarctions compared to 215 (5.1%) given placebo: OR 0.70 95% CI: 0.57–0.86, P = 0.0008). However, extended-release metoprolol was associated with higher incidences of ==strokes== and ==deaths==; and more frequent ==hypotension== and ==bradycardia==, perioperatively. Therefore, ==β blockers initiation== in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery is currently not recommended

> [!NOTE] POISE-2
> POISE-2 trial randomized 10 000 surgical patients to start or continue ==aspirin==, or to placebo. The primary composite outcome including death or nonfatal MI occurred in 351 patients (7.0%) in the aspirin group, and 355 (7.1%) in the placebo group; 6.2% and 6.3%, respectively had MI, with no between-group difference. In contrast, patients assigned to aspirin had ==more major bleeding==. According to a factorial design, in POISE-2 patients were also randomized to ==clonidine== or placebo. Again, there was no difference in the primary outcome, nor in MI, with more patients in the clonidine group having ==bradycardia== and ==hypotension==

> [!NOTE] ENIGMA-2
> ENIGMA-2 trial randomized 7112 surgical patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease to either ==nitrous oxide== or nitrogen during anesthesia. The primary outcome was cardiac morbidity defined as a composite of death and cardiovascular complications (nonfatal MI, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac arrest) within 30 days of surgery. MI occurred in 283 (8%) of patients given nitrous oxide and in 296 (8%) of patients given nitrogen (relative risk 0.96 95% CI: 0.83, 1.12, P = 0.64).

# Post-op surveillance
About 93% of MINS and 68% of MI are typically unrecognized without ==troponin screening==.
Consequently, routine troponin screening is required, independent of any clinical symptoms

Routine troponin measurement is ==cost effective==, although cost varies considerably from county-to-country and depends on the specific troponin assay used

==Trending troponin== (i.e., repeat troponin measurements) is fundamental to distinguish between acute and chronic troponin elevation, and to follow the evolution of troponin elevation

The ==peak== of troponin elevation is of prognostic importance and may influence decisions regarding type and timing of cardiac testing and initiation of cardiovascular medications.
