# Obstetric haemorrhage
[[pages/Postpartum haemorrhage\|Postpartum haemorrhage]] (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide, responsible for up to 27.1% of deaths, and is one of the most preventable causes of death


# Physiology of maternal haemostasis
During normal pregnancy, there is
- 30-50% ↑ in plasma volume
- 20% ↑ in RBC volume
→ relative state of ==hemodilution==

↓plt ∵ ↑ plasma volume combined with ↑ consumption by the uteroplacental unit, with ==gestational thrombocytopenia== (platelet count <150x10^9/L) occurring in ==5-10%== of pregnancies

Overall, hemostasis is tipped towards a ==prothrombotic== state with an ↑ in all procoagulant factors, excluding factors ==XI and XIII==

During pregnancy, [[Knowledge/Medicine/Fibrinogen\|fibrinogen]] levels ↑ to ==4-6 g/L== (compared to 2-4 g/L in the non-pregnant population) whereas PT and aPTT times may shorten

Acquired ==protein C resistance== and a ↓ in ==Protein S activity== signify a ↓ in innate anticoagulant effectiveness

A ↓ in overall ==fibrinolytic== activity occurs despite ↑ in D dimer (a specific fibrin degradation product)

↑ levels of ==plasminogen activator inhibitor 1== (PAI-1) and ==placental-derived PAI-2== and a corresponding ↓ in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) also occur

In the normal process of haemostasis, the response to vascular injury is the rapid formation of a ==platelet and fibrin clot== to prevent haemorrhage

==In vivo==, the cellular model of haemostasis consists of overlapping phases including 
- initiation, 
- amplification
- propagation
