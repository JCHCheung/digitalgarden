# Obstetric haemorrhage
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide, responsible for up to 27.1% of deaths, and is one of the most preventable causes of death


# Physiology of maternal haemostasis
In the normal process of haemostasis, the response to vascular injury is the rapid formation of a ==platelet and fibrin clot== to prevent haemorrhage

==In vivo==, the cellular model of haemostasis consists of overlapping phases including 
- initiation, 
- amplification
- propagation
