# left posterior fascicular block
right axis deviation
lead I & aVL : rS
III : qR

less common than [[pages/left anterior fascicular block\|LAFB]] ∵ broad bundle more resistant to damage
need to r/o other causes of RAD first

Guideline definition
1. Frontal plane axis between 90° and 180° in adults. 
	- Owing to the more rightward axis in children up to 16 years of age, this criterion should only be applied to them when a distinct rightward change in axis is documented. 
2. rS pattern in leads I and aVL. 
3. qR pattern in leads III and aVF. 
4. QRS duration less than 120 ms.
