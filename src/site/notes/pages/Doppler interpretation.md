# Doppler interpretation



Venous doppler sampled near to RV → indicates interaction btwn [[VR\|VR]] & RV function
Venous doppler sampled distant to RV → indicates interaction of venous pressure & ==peripheral venous limits of compliance==

resistive indices affected by systemic factors more than local factors
