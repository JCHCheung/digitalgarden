# Caesarean section

Caesarean delivery (CD) is the most performed inpatient surgery worldwide


Enhanced Recovery After Caesarean (ERAC) builds upon ERAS principles to address the unique needs and challenges of obstetric patients


## SOAP guideline
The 25 interventions that SOAP recommends are: 
- limiting the duration of fasting; 
- nonparticulate liquid carbohydrate loading; 
- patient education;
- promotion of breastfeeding and maternal-infant bonding; 
- hemoglobin optimisation; 
- prevention and treatment of hypotension caused by spinal anesthesia; 
- maintenance of normothermia;
- optimising uterotonic administration; 
- antibiotic prophylaxis; 
- initiation of multimodal analgesia; 
- IONV/PONV prophylaxis;
- intravenous (IV) fluid optimisation; 
- delayed umbilical cord clamping; 
- venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, 
- encouraging rest periods; 
- early mobilisation; 
- early urinary catheter removal; 
- early oral intake; 
- facilitating early discharge; 
- anaemia remediation; 
- breastfeeding support;
- multimodal analgesia; 
- glucose control; 
- promotion of the return of bowel function

## ERAS guideline
The ERAS Society has few recommendations specific to CD. They include delayed cord-clamping, prioritizing a transverse uterine hysterotomy, use of subcuticular sutures, and removal of the urinary catheter in the immediate postoperative period

PROSPECT guidelines recommend the use of ==postpartum epidural analgesia for OUD==, due to the significantly increased postoperative opioid requirements expected.

Current evidence suggests that the relatively low occurrence of chronic pain after CD compared to other surgical procedures may be attributed to factors such as neuraxial anaesthesia and potential protective effects from endogenous oxytocin secretion

Neuraxial anaesthesia during CD, particularly when intrathecal opioids are administered, may play a role in preventing the development of chronic pain, although current evidence does not support the role of intrathecal morphine (ITM) for this purpose

## [[Knowledge/Medicine/Neuraxial block\|Neuraxial block]]
Neuraxial anaesthesia is recommended for CD by SOAP, the Obstetric Anaesthetists' Association, American Pain Society and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence

Intrathecal fentanyl and ITM are the preferred neuraxial adjuvants to local anaesthetic agents for CD anesthesia and analgesia. A dose-response study showed that 50 mcg ITM was as effective as 100 and 150 mcg

A meta-analysis concluded that high doses >100 mcg were more likely to be associated with adverse side effects

It is important to identify women with increased risk of ==respiratory depression==, as they might require more intensive postoperative monitoring after ITM. The rate of clinically significant respiratory depression following contemporary doses of ITM is 1.08-1.63 per 10,000

## Non-opioids analgesics
paracetamol & NSAID safe for breast feeding

NSAIDs should be prescribed in a ==scheduled== manner rather than as-needed, as this strategy has been shown to reduce opioid consumption following caesarean delivery

## Dexamethasone
Intravenous dexamethasone during CD has been associated with ==better pain scores== and ==prolonged analgesia== with reduced need for further ==anti-emetics==

## Gabapentin
Gabapentin exerts its analgesic effect by modulating the activity of ==voltage-gated calcium channels== and enhancing GABA inhibitory neurotransmission. These mechanisms are thought to reduce pain signaling and dampen the central sensitization associated with postoperative pain

not much use in CS
## Nerve blocks

### TAP block
↓ pain if no ITM in first 24h
?? in the presence of ITM

### QL block
↓ pain if no ITM

### Would infiltration / catheters
no additional benefit if ITM present
