## Pre-briefing
Benefits
- shared mental model
- give the team some autonomy to work in the first few min
3 questions
1. What do we ==know==?
	- e.g. What do we know about the patient coming into the trauma bay in 5min?
2. What are our anticipated ==priorities==?
	- could be initiated by a member (instead of team lead)
	- lay out the important things need to be addressed
3. ==Who== is our team + what is our ==roles==?

"What am ==I== missing?" by ==team lead==
- psychological safety
	- not yes / no question "have I missed sth?"
	- not what are ==we== missing
- â†’ encourage opinions
