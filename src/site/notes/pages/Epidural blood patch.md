# Epidural blood patch
The EBP has been the cornerstone of [[pages/Post-dural puncture headache\|PDPH]] treatment, since Gormley observed that bloody taps during spinal anaesthesia were associated with a lower PDPH incidence

EBP involves the injection of autologous blood into the epidural space

hypothesized two-fold effect:
- ↑ epidural and lumbar CSF pressure
- stimulating fibroblastic repair in proximity to the dural defect

The immediate but transient increase in epidural volume increases the spinal and intracranial CSF pressure
no demonstrated relationship between the final epidural pressure generated during the procedure and its success

An ==epidural hematoma== is known to be a ==potent cerebral vasoconstrictor== which may contribute to the positive outcome

MRI studies have shown that the mass effect of injected blood lasts only a few hours, and then ==clot== forms within ==7 hours==, which stimulates fibroblastic and collagen repair of the dural defect, preventing further CSF leakage

==Efficacy== of an EBP procedure ==varies== significantly, likely reflecting procedural and patient-related factors and the extent of dural damage
For PDPH after ==spinal== anaesthesia, EBP success rates of ==75- 96%== have been reported

After ==ADP== with ==large gauge== Tuohy needles in obstetrics, complete and permanent resolution of symptoms after one EBP occurs in ==less than 50%== of patients

## EPiMAP study
- large prospective international cohort study of 647 obstetric patients
- investigating risk factors for EBP failure after ADP
- complete success 
	- (defined as an NRS score of 0 in upright position at 4, 24 and/or 48 hours) 
	- only 33.0%
- Complete failure
	- (NRS scores ≥ 7 at one of these time points or the need for a 2nd EBP)
	- 28.7%
- 19.8% ultimately requiring second EBP
- no association btwn EBP failure &
	- EBP lumbar level,
	- position during EBP,
	- operator experience
- The only associations with failure of EBP were
	- timing of the EBP,
	- a history of migraine
		- specifically associated with ↑ 2nd EBP, 
	- (unexpectedly) a higher lumbar level of the original ADP.
- early EBP
	- w/i 48 hours after ADP
	- more likely to require a repeat procedure
	- (not known whether earlier EBP a/w more severe PDPH symptoms)

∴ if an ==early EBP== is recommended to patients, they should be informed of the possibility of a ==repeat EBP== to achieve complete resolution of symptoms
However, ==delaying== an EBP for patients with severe symptoms is not recommended, as it ==prolongs patient suffering== and may ↑ risk of ==rare severe complications== such as subdural hematoma

Complications of EBP
- most common: back pain ~80%
- Chronic headache
	- is not significantly reduced in patients who were treated with an EBP
- Serious neurologic conditions:
	- Arachnoiditis,
	- radiculitis, 
	- meningitis
	- spinal subdural hematoma,
