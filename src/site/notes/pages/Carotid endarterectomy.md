# Carotid endarterectomy


# Pre-op
2% of CEA have a peri-op CVA

Hypertension
- ==DBP >110== predicts adverse events
	- if elective → delay OT
	- inpatient stroke patient w/ unstable plaque : risk vs benefit analysis


# Intra-op

### LA vs GA
patient factor
- tolerate phrenic n. palsy?
- cooperative?
surgical factor
- long OT
- high lesion

## Technique & consideration
Good IV

Wrist restraint (surgical side)

Bair hugger standby
too warm → ↑CMRO2
too cold → shiver → ↑myocardial O2 consumption

Fire risk

Sedation:
small, titratable doses of a reversible (or short acting) agent

### A line
for beat-to-beat variability
freq blood gas & Hcue assessment
evaluate SVV

### Anticoagulation
heparin usually 80mg/kg
target ACT 200-250s

NOT reversed after carotid artery ==stenting==


## Sudden brady
∵ stimulation of carotid ==sinus== baroreceptor
1. atropine
	- (+) surgeon infiltrate carotid
2. (chest compression)
3. (transcutaneous pacing)

## Ischaemia monitoring

==Documentation== is important on ==how you react== to the changes noted on monitor

#### EEG:
if Δ after clamp
- surgeon may place a shunt
- keep BP up
- if still not solved → surgeon may decide to abort vs continue

#### cerebral oximetry
if ↓
- surgeons alerted
- MAP increased
- shunt placed
- surgeon decided to proceed

## Carotid ==shunt== problems
- carotid emboli
- intimal dissection
- limited surgical exposure

### Carotid ==body== denervation
- 2/2 surgical manipulation
- → impaired response to hypoxia (==chemical== receptor)
	- normally compensated by response to CO2
- exaggerated w/ mod-severe COPD / OHS
# Post-op
## Haemodynamics

#### ↓BP
∵ carotid ==sinus== baroreceptor now "seeing" the pressure and responding
happening towards the end → have pressor ready
#### ↑BP
if surgeons have infiltrated the carotid sinus
if BP ↑ >25% → control it to avoid hyperperfusion syndrome

## Δ in mental status
ask surgeon to come
DDx:
- haematoma
- nerve injury
- intimal flap
- cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome
## Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome

leads to cerebral oedema

may occur wks later
