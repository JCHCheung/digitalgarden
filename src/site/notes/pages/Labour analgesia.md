# Labour analgesia

# Neuraxial labour analgesia
Neuraxial techniques have consistently emerged as the gold standard in labour pain management, offering unparalleled efficacy compared to alternative modalities.

The choice of saline over air is often favoured due to its potential to mitigate adverse effects, such as a decreased incidence of [[postdural puncture headache\|postdural puncture headache]] (PDPH) and lower likelihood of uneven block distribution

## [[pages/epidural anaesthesia\|EA]] vs CSE vs DPE
### CSE - Adv
CSE technique is increasingly favoured for its ==rapid onset of profound pain relief==, particularly during advanced stages of labour. This method typically achieves analgesia within 2 to 10 minutes, compared to the 15 to 20 minutes required by traditional epidural analgesia

more uniform sensory blockade
enhanced coverage of the sacral dermatomes

Experts have raised concerns regarding the delayed confirmation of correct epidural catheter placement following CSE analgesia; however, evidence suggests that CSE technique is less prone to failure, potentially due to improved confirmation of midline needle placement in the epidural space through CSF visualisation

lower the incidence of unilateral anaesthesia cf [[pages/epidural anaesthesia\|EA]]
### CSE - Disadv
maternal hypotension
opioid-induced pruritus
foetal heart rate changes

## DPE
DPE analgesia offers a promising alternative. This technique facilitates quicker analgesic onset and better sacral spread than the epidural technique while potentially reducing side effects associated with CSE

DPE analgesia may be suitable for patients with suspected difficult airways or failed epidural labour analgesia, enabling confirmation of proximity to the dura with the dural puncture and spinal fluid return, but not eliciting adverse effects associated with CSE dosing

Concerns about postdural puncture headache (PDPH) associated with creating a hole in the dura have led to hesitancy in some to use either the CSE or DPE techniques. However, such concerns may not be well-founded, as evidenced by a study in nearly 20,000 women conducted in 2004 by Pan et al. They found that CSE or epidural technique had a similar need for an epidural blood patch

The evolution of continuous epidural infusions (CEI) using automated pumps limited the need for intermittent top-ups, reducing clinician workload substantially. However, the use of CEI alone resulted in a high rate of motor block

This phenomenon can be explained by the pharmacodynamics of nerve blocks, where ==continuous== infusion in the extraneural space establishes a diffusion gradient, leading to an equilibrium between intraneural and extraneural concentrations and subsequent blockade of both sensory and motor nerve fibers

The combination of ==PCEA with CEI== as a background infusion improved analgesia consistency, but increased the risk of anaesthetic consumption and the ==risk of instrumental vaginal delivery==

Since the early 2000s, programmed intermittent epidural bolus (PIEB) has been utilised to achieve a ==wider sensory block== and better ==homogeneous distribution==, often in conjunction with CEI or PCEA

PCEA + CEI vs CEI alone
- ↓ total local anaesthetic doses,
- ↓ motor block,
- ↓ need for intervention, 
- ↑ pain relief
- ↑ patient satisfaction

PIEB vs CEI
- ↓ total LA consumption
- ↑ maternal satisfaction
- ↓ need for intervention w/ top-ups
- ↓ motor block
- ↓ instrumental vaginal deliveries

Emerging techniques such as computer-integrated PCEA (CIPCEA) allow for adaptive maintenance based on usage patterns, providing flexible analgesia adjustments over time
#### Bolus rate
The rate of bolus delivery seems to impact effectiveness, with ==high velocity== injections favourable, although this may increase the risk of hypotension and motor block
## LA choice
Traditionally, epidural solutions for labour analgesia employed highly concentrated local anaesthetic solutions, which often resulted in increased motor blockade and reduced maternal satisfaction

the shift towards more dilute local solutions has yielded promising outcomes. Studies have consistently shown that using lower concentrations of local anaesthetics is associated with a lower incidence of assisted vaginal deliveries, less motor block, greater ambulation, and a shorter second stage of labour compared to high concentration solutions

↓ motor block while maintaining effective analgesic levels → facilitate more effective pushing and patient engagement in the second stage of labour

low conc. = <0.125%
## Adjuvants
### Opioids
Neuraxial opioids play a crucial role in labour analgesia, exhibiting a synergistic effect when combined with local anaesthetic. This combination enhances analgesic effects, allowing a reduction in local anaesthetic dosing and consequently lowering the risk of systemic toxicity

The addition of a ==lipophilic== opioid such as fentanyl or sufentanil has shown promise, potentially reducing the local anaesthetic requirements by up to four-fold

This combined approach not only minimises the required dose for each agent, thus limiting toxicity, but also extends the duration of analgesic effects, diminishes motor block, and enhances patient satisfaction when compared to the use of local anaesthetic alone

Extensive evidence supports the use of ==high-volume, low-concentration== dosing of local anaesthetic in combination with a ==lipophilic opioid== for epidural labour analgesia. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage from T10 to S3 with less motor block and better labour outcomes

= "Low dose EA"

Meta-analyses endorse the use of ==low-concentration== local anaesthetic solutions, such as ==≤0.1-0.15% bupivacaine==, which pose ==no increased risk== of assisted vaginal delivery compared to non-epidural analgesia


> [!NOTE] ASA Guideline
> standard practice: use dilute concentrations of local anaesthetics with lipophilic opioids to achieve minimal motor block. 
> 
> Typically, this involves the administration of 1-3 μg/mL fentanyl or 0.5-1 μg/mL sufentanil.
> 
> For ==intrathecal== dosing, recommended amounts are 10-25 μg fentanyl or 2-5 μg sufentanil

### non-opioids
#### Clonidine & dexmedetomidine
Both α2-receptors agonists exert their analgesic effects through the α2-receptors located in the spinal cord

Intrathecal clonidine dosing ranges from 15-45 μg, with a study from Missant et al. demonstrating the potential for stronger and prolonged analgesia, although with a trade-off of significant refractory hypotension.

both ==oral and intravenous== administration of clonidine and dexmedetomidine have been found to prolong the anaesthetic effect of intrathecal local anaesthetics.

For ==epidural== administration doses of 30-150 μg have shown a good analgesic effect. However, doses of 75 μg and higher may lead to sedation, hypotension, and bradycardia, and alterations in foetal heart rhythm

#### Adrenaline
Epinephrine also acts through α2-receptors, although vasoconstrictive effects might be involved as well

It can contribute to epidural administration by significantly reducing the minimum local analgesic concentration (MLAC) of bupivacaine, thereby improving quality of analgesia

Disadv
- ↑ incidence maternal motor deficit
- possible prolongation of labour duration
- the need for pre-prepared solutions
	- → complicating storage and raising drug prices

beneficial effect in the context of labour epidural analgesia remains uncertain

#### Neostigmine
Neostigmine exhibits its effect as an indirect parasympathomimetic by inhibiting cholinesterase, thereby prolonging and enhancing the effect of acetylcholine on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors.

While it can be administered intrathecally or epidurally with good analgesic effect, it is associated with severe nausea and vomiting which precludes recommendation for its routine use
