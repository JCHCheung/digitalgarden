# Factor VIIa

In cardiac surgical patients, both the ESAIC and SCA guidelines are in general agreement, suggesting that rVIIa be considered only for bleeding refractory to conventional therapies, and after weighing the risk of potentially life-threatening thrombosis

The SCA suggests that low dose rFVIIa (20–40 mcg/kg) be considered in these situations

For liver transplantation, ESAIC recommends that rVIIa be reserved only as a rescue therapy in uncontrolled bleeding. This is similar to the use of rFVIIa in trauma patients, where it is a last resort treatment for medical coagulopathy, and efficacy and safety data is limited.
