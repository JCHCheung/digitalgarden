# Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
0.1-0.3% of general population
can be intermittent
### Classical WPW triad:
- Short PR interval
	- < 120ms
    - Not universal
	    - may be a bit longer depending on distance from sinus node to accessory pathway
	    - 120-140ms PR intervals do not necessarily r/o WPW
- Delta waves
	- slurring and slow rise of the initial upstroke of the QRS
    - May be very subtle or seen in only 1-2 leads
        - Beware “pseudo-deltas” that may mimic WPW but do not have other triad findings to avoid misdiagnosis
- Widened QRS interval
	- 120ms
    - Modified conduction through the accessory pathway will cause abnormal ventricular depolarization and result in secondary ST segment and T wave abnormalities
### WPW + [[pages/supraventricular tachyarrhythmia\|SVT]]
- ==Narrow== complex ==regular== rhythm
	- ==orthodromic== AVRT
	- looks like other types of paroxysmal [[pages/supraventricular tachyarrhythmia\|SVT]], treat like usual [[pages/supraventricular tachyarrhythmia\|SVT]] with AV nodal blockers
- ==Wide== complex ==regular== rhythm
	- ==antidromic== AVRT
	- looks like [[pages/Ventricular tachycardia\|VT]] → treat like [[pages/Ventricular tachycardia\|VT]]
Possibility of [[Knowledge/Part 2/Pharmacology/adenosine#Adenosine induced atrial fibrillation\|adenosine induced AF]]
## Pre-excited [[pages/atrial fibrillation\|AF]]
- Very rapid ==irregularly irregular tachycardia==
	- rates may approach ==250-300== beats/min
	- ==changing morphology==
		- some narrow (via AVN)
		- some wide (via accessory pathway)
		- some fusion
- Often misdiagnosed as SVT, VT, or atrial fibrillation with BBB
    - Misdiagnosis and treatment with AVN blockers can be deadly!
- Treat with procainamide, flecainide, or preferably ==electrical cardioversion==
- Avoid all AV Nodal blockers
    - [[Knowledge/Part 2/Pharmacology/adenosine\|adenosine]]
	- Beta-blockers
	- Calcium channel blockers
	- Digoxin
	- Amiodarone
very rarely for [[pages/atrial fibrillation\|AF]] (w/o accessory pathway) to reach HR >200bpm
- ∵ blocked by AV node
if HR >250bpm & irregular → pre-excited AF until proven otherwise
[[procainamide\|procainamide]] preferably block accessory pathways
### DDx
[[pages/Ashman phenomenon\|Ashman phenomenon]]: stable
[[TdP\|TdP]]: changing ==axis==
- doesn't matter just DC cardioversion ∵ patient couldn't be stable for long
