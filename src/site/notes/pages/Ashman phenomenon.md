# Ashman phenomenon
first reported in 1947 by Gouaux & Ashman
they showed that the earlier in the cardiac cycle a premature atrial contraction (PAC) occurs, and the longer the preceding cycle is, the more likely that PAC conduction will deviate from the normal pathway and be conducted with aberration
Benign condition
physiological ==aberrancy== of ventricular conduction due to a change in QRS cycle length
- ==long → short== cycle
- esp likely w/ short-long-short cycle
- usually [[RBBB\|RBBB]] morphology best seen in ==V1==
	- ∵ Rt bundle has longer refractory period
can occur in any [[pages/supraventricular tachyarrhythmia\|supraventricular tachyarrhythmia]]
- most commonly [[pages/atrial fibrillation\|atrial fibrillation]]
==refractory period== of ventricle related to duration of preceding ==RR interval==
→ aberrant conduction if atrial impulse arrives during refractory period

when aberrancy occurs in groups, can resemble [[pages/Ventricular tachycardia\|VT]] or PVC

Treatment: ==rate control==
