# Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy has arguably made the largest contribution to the recent improvements in cancer survival rates. The main modalities include:
- Monoclonal antibodies: 
	- synthetic antibodies that target specific antigens.
- Immune checkpoint inhibitors: 
	- these block surface proteins primarily expressed on immune cells that partially restore anticancer immune mechanisms.
- Adoptive T-cell therapy ([[pages/CAR-T cell therapy\|CAR-T cell therapy]]): 
	- genetically trained host T cells against cancer cells.
- Immune system modulators: 
	- these destroy cancer cells by increasing circulating cytokines or minimise the effects of cancer treatment.
