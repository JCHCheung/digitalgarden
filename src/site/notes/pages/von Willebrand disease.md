# von Willebrand disease
Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most frequent ==autosomal inherited== bleeding disorder, is caused by ==quantitative== or ==qualitative== defects of von Willebrand factor (VWF), an adhesive protein that binds platelets to exposed sub-endothelium and carries factor VIII (==FVIII==) in circulation.
As a consequence, in addition to the defect of VWF, also FVIII, the protein deficient in [[haemophilia A\|haemophilia A]], may be variably reduced in VWD patients

==Quantitative== deficiency of VWF
- Type 1 ==Partial== quantitative deficiency of VWF
	- mildest
	- ↓ synthesis or ↑ clearance (Type 1C)
- Type 3 Virtually ==complete== deficiency of VWF (& ↓↓ F8 )
	- rare
	- clinically most severe
==Qualitative== deficiency of VWF = ==Type 2==
- Type 2A
	- ==↓ platelet-dependent function== a/w absence of high- and intermediate-molecular weight ==VWF multimers==
- Type 2B
	- ↑ affinity for ==platelet GPIb==
		- plt-vWF complexes cleared by ADAMTS13 → ↓ vWF & ↓ plt
	- vs platelet type : abnormality lies in plt
- Type 2M
	- ↓ platelet-dependent function ==not== caused by the absence of high-molecular weight VWF multimers
	- "M" ∵ ==multimer== assembly unaffected
- Type 2N
	- markedly ↓ affinity for ==factor VIII==
		- (vWF ↓ F8 T1/2)
		- ∴ ↓ F8 levels
	- "N" = ==Normandy==, where it's first discovered
	- differentiated from [[haemophilia A\|haemophilia A]] by:
		- autosomal recessive inheritence
		- genetic studies


treatment of VWD requires the correction of the dual haemostatic defect (low ==FVIII== and low/abnormal ==VWF==).
These goals can be achieved by increasing plasma concentrations of these factors through their release from endothelial cells with [[Knowledge/Medicine/Vasopressin#Desmopressin\|desmopressin]] ([[pages/DDAVP\|DDAVP]]) or by using replacement therapy with human plasma-derived (pd) low-purity VWF/FVIII concentrates or a high-purity VWF product.

# Lab test
↓ plt (usually mild ~100-140) if Type 2B
↑ aPTT ∝ ↓ F8 activity
PT normal
microcytic anaemia if IDA

vWF antigen (vWF:Ag): ==quantitative== measurement of vWF protein level
- not imply Fx activity
- IU/dL = %
plt dependent vWF ==activity== e.g. vWF:RCo
- assess ability of vWF to bind to plt
Factor VIII activity

Test may be affected by acute illness (vWF & F8 are acute phase reactants), pregnancy, oestrogen exposure (↑ vWF)

derived ratios:
- plt dependent vWF activity to vWF:Ag → Type 2
	- normally >0.7 (or close to 1)
	- not applicable to Type 3 as levels too low
- F8 activity to vWF:Ag
	- Type 2N

## [[pages/DDAVP\|DDAVP]]
DDAVP response is mainly dependent on ==genotype== and ==phenotype==
a ==test-dose== infusion at the time of diagnosis is recommended to establish the ==pattern of response and its duration==

Progressive reduced response to DDAVP can be observed due to =depletion= of VWF/FVIII from the storages (==tachyphylaxis==) after repeated treatments (usually >3 over 24 hours)

The risk of ==hyponatremia== is remote when using a single dose in adults but caution should be used in ==pregnancy== ([[pages/Preeclampsia\|PET]] & [[pages/Oxytocin\|Oxytocin]] use further ↑ risks), and fluid restriction is advisable when further dose(s) is required along with monitoring of urinary output and serum electrolytes.

DDAVP is usually effective in patients with ==type 1== VWD and baseline VWF and FVIII levels ==≥10 IU/dL== 
==variable== responses are observed in ==type 2== VWD patients

In ==type 2B==, DDAVP is generally ==contraindicated== ∵ transient appearance or aggravation of ==thrombocytopenia== leading to ↑ risk of bleeding

Type 3 VWD → unresponsive

# Obstetric considerations
Pregnancy is considered as a hypercoagulable state ∵ because several hemostatic factors increase throughout
- Factor VII,
- factor X, 
- fibrinogen
- plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1
free protein S ↓

VWF and FVIII ↑ significantly during pregnancy in normal women reaching the greatest level during the ==3rd trimester==, with levels far > 100 U/dL by the time of parturition.

Whether or not women with VWD are at ↑ risk of ==spontaneous abortion== is ==unclear== from the literature

A progressive ↑ of FVIII and VWF occurs in most women w/ ==type 1== VWD, the partial quantitative deficiency of the disorder, with levels reaching >50 U/dL in the 3rd trimester

In general, women with levels at baseline of VWF and FVIII >==30 U/dL==, suggesting ==type 1== VWD, usually have a high likelihood to achieve normal levels at the end of pregnancy

Women with basal levels <==20 U/dL== usually have a lesser increase since most of these women carry DNA variants associated with increased VWF clearance or decreased synthesis and secretion or are compound heterozygous for different VWF variants which prevent the achievement of satisfactory hemostatic levels

Ideally, the results of a test-infusion with [[pages/DDAVP\|DDAVP]] should be available before pregnancy for every woman with VWD and basal level of FVIII and VWF <30 U/dL

VWD patients should be monitored for VWF:RCo and FVIII:C ==at least once== during the ==3rd trimester== of pregnancy
The risk of bleeding is minimal when FVIII:C and VWF:RCo levels w/o treatment during pregnancy are ==≥50 U/dL==
risk of bleeding is highest in those who do not self-correct, even if treated

## Type 1
In ==type 1== VWD, pregnant women with FVIII:C and/or VWF levels lower than ==30 U/dL== at time of parturition, the administration of ==desmopressin== after umbilical clamping and for 3-4 days thereafter is required especially when midline episiotomy is required. 
The IV route elicits the ==same increase== as that of the SC one, but the ==time to peak== is generally shorter.
However, ==monitoring== FVIII and VWF levels is advisable, especially when repeated doses are given
Monitoring of urinary output and fluid restriction are necessary to avoid the risk of ==hyponatremia==

alternative approaches using ==VWF/FVIII concentrates== are also used in some Countries especially when close surveillance of the patient is not easily available. In this case, ==40-60 IU/kg VWF== is administered during the late stage of labour and repeated once daily for at least 3 days, followed by oral [[Knowledge/Medicine/Tranexamic acid\|TXA]] for a week.

## Other variants
### 2A
==Type 2A== VWD is characterised by
- lack of high-molecular weight multimers
- abnormal VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag (<0.6)
During pregnancy, multimer abnormalities usually do not correct and VWF:RCo remains markedly reduced. However, a significant increase of FVIII and VWF:Ag may occur
These patients usually require treatment with FVIII/VWF concentrates
### 2B (DDAVP C/I)
Worsening of pre-existing ==thrombocytopenia== is the most important change observed in ==type 2B== VWD women during pregnancy because ↑ release of abnormal multimers with enhanced affinity for glycoprotein Ib on platelet surface occurs.
However, its severity is strongly dependent on the specific amino acid change in the A1 domain of VWF responsible for the patient's disease, with some DNA variants resulting in normal platelet counts (eg c.3797C>T, p.Pro1266Leu) while others are associated with severe thrombocytopenia (eg c.3922C>T, p.Arg1308Cys and c.3946G>A, p.Met1316Val).
Regardless of the DNA variant, or if it is not known, platelet count should be also closely monitored during pregnancy in women with this type

In some women with platelet count <==30 000/µL==, platelet transfusion has been used, despite the fact that pseudo-thrombocytopenia is partly responsible for platelet lowering as assessed by the presence of platelet clumps on peripheral blood smear
### 2M
Women with ==type 2M== VWD often show a significant correction of FVIII and VWF:Ag, while VWF:RCo does not reach levels of 50 U/dL. 
This is similar to the pattern observed after desmopressin in these patients and means that factor replacement should be used
### 2N
In ==type 2N== VWD, normalisation of FVIII, which is more reduced compared to VWF in this type, usually occurs during pregnancy in women heterozygous or homozygous for the most frequent DNA variant and amino acid change responsible for this type (c.2561G>A, p.Arg854Gln), similar to what happens after desmopressin

the results of a ==desmopressin trial== before pregnancy are helpful to predict its usefulness at parturition. 
in unresponsive women, during labour and before epidural anaesthesia, 50 IU/kg of VWF should be administered, followed by 30-40 IU/kg/daily for at least 3 days. 
Daily monitoring of FVIII and VWF activity is recommended during the same period. Oral tranexamic acid is advised (15-25 mg/kg) up to 10-15 days.
### Type 3
Women with type 3 VWD typically do not show any increase of FVIII and VWF during pregnancy because their ==endothelial VWF stores are lacking==. Thus, VWF/FVIII concentrates may be required during pregnancy to control intermittent vaginal bleeding and at delivery or for caesarean section

Replacement therapy is as suggested above, but it usually should be ==prolonged== up to 5-7 days to maintain FVIII:C (and possibly VWF) level >50 U/dL

Usual ==thrombo-prophylactic== treatment with LMWH should be considered in patients at high risk of venous thrombosis during replacement therapy for caesarean section, especially if high FVIII levels are anticipated by using replacement treatment
## Post partum
Factor VIII and VWF ==fall to baseline== levels soon after delivery 
oral antifibrinolytic agents (eg [[Knowledge/Medicine/Tranexamic acid\|TXA]] 1 g every 8 hours up to 2 weeks) can be used during this period to prevent delayed [[Knowledge/Part 2/Obs/Postpartum haemorrhage\|PPH]] due to heavy lochia. 
Tranexamic acid appears to decrease the risk of delayed [[Knowledge/Part 2/Obs/Postpartum haemorrhage\|PPH]] and appears to be safe during lactation.
