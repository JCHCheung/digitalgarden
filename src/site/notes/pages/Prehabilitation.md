# Prehabilitation

==1 MET = 3.5ml/kg/min==

==2 FOS = 4 MET = 14ml/kg/min== consumption

VO2 peak same concept as MET (∴ same unit)

AT: when ↑VCO2 rate > ↑VO2 rate

==AT >11ml/kg/min==

CPET
- VO2 peak: cardiopulmonary function
- AT: muscle bulk

6MWT & DASI most c/w CPET (used if no $ )

DASI:
limitation: not validated in Chinese population

modified DASI = 5 Qs
modified DASI 4 = 5 Qs - sexual relation

DASI cutoff = 34
modified DASI cutoff = 2

Pre-op modifiable risks

==multimodal== prehabilitation

==definition== of prehab: enhancing the functional capacity of a person to withstand a stressful event
- resilience
- response
- recovery

6MWT: 20m = clinically significant

implication of JAMA paper: prehab may be useful if
- 6MWT <400m
- age >60yo

Nutrition:
MST: malnutrition screening tool

immunonutrition: benefit in major surgery

Functional capacity:
ASA: historical reason → out of favour

SORT:
- UK cohort
- may not apply locally

POSSUM: may not useful pre-op

NSQIP
- US cohort
- update yearly w/ data

Prehab limitation: e.g. travelling, delaying OT, cost (e.g. CPET)

frailty is not an illness, but a syndrome that combines the effects of natural ageing with the outcomes of multiple long-term conditions, and a loss of fitness, strength, and physiological reserves

The fact that multimodal interventions have a greater magnitude of effect than individual interventions exemplifies the ==marginal gains theory==, popularised in the sport of cycling and advocated in aviation, business, and even healthcare
