# lead misplacement
## V1-2 too high
PMID 28213958:
- 1435 ECGs randomly selected
    - ==Biphasic== P waves in V2 in only 10.5%
    - ==Inverted== P waves in V2 in only 4.8%
    - Usually caused by:
	    - left atrial abnormalities, 
	    - septal MI,
	    - V1-V2 placed ==too high== on the precordium

As the leads are moved higher, ==V1-V2== demonstrate…
- False incomplete [[RBBB\|RBBB]] type pattern
    - Often with an Rsr’ pattern as opposed to typical (I)RBBB patterns that have rsR’
    - (typically have a larger second upward deflection, consider lead misplacement when the first upward deflection is higher than the second)
- ST elevation
- septal Q waves
- TWI in V1-V2 (usually not out to V3)
    - Normal in V1, but not usually normal in V2
- Inverted P waves
    - Normal in V1, but not usually normal in V2
