# Steroid



## Steroid in [[septic shock\|septic shock]]
The mechanism of action for corticosteroids in septic shock includes mitigation of ==relative adrenal insufficiency== as well as sodium retention and ==reduction of capillary leakage==.

Potential benefits
- ↓ mortality
- ↓ organ failure rates
- ↑ vasopressor-free days
- faster resolution of shock & time to discharge from ICU

2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign suggests intravenous hydrocortisone should be administered as 50 mg intravenous every 6 h or a continuous infusion for a total of 200 mg per day. These guidelines suggest the initiation of corticosteroids when a patient has received a dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine greater than or equal to ==0.25 mcg/kg/min for at least 4 h==

2024 Critical Care Medicine guideline also recommends administering corticosteroids to adult patients with septic shock

Trials
- CORTICUS
- APROCCHSS
