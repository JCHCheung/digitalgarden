# Paed
in children, BMI varies with age and gender and it can be more appropriate to use centiles. ==BMI centiles== can be determined using age and sex specific percentiles and interpreted in this fashion when evaluating children who are overweight and obese for appropriate treatment

BMI is a validated proxy measure of underlying adiposity that is replicable and can track weight status in children and adolescents and can be used for children >2 years old.

More than 90% of childhood obesity is due to excessive energy intake and insufficient energy expenditure; rarely, it is secondary to hormonal or genetic causes (e.g. Prader–Willi, Cushing's or Lawrence–Moon–Biedl syndromes) or use of medication (glucocorticoids, antidepressants)

Associated comorbidities
- SDB
- recurrent respiratory infections
- [[pages/asthma\|asthma]]
- hypertension
- left ventricular hypertrophy (adolescents)
- diabetes mellitus
- metabolic syndrome (central obesity, hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidaemia)
- [[pages/GORD\|GORD]]
- Preoperative anxiety; low self-esteem, poor school performance.
- Difficult venous access.
- Altered drug pharmacokinetics

IV drug dose in obese children
- IBW
	- midazolam
	- morphine
	- non-depolarising NMBA
- LBW
	- propofol induction
	- thiopentone
	- fentanyl
	- remifentanil
- TBW
	- propofol infusion
	- suxamethonium
	- sugammadex
	- lignocaine
	- neostigmine
**IBW** = (BMI at the 50th percentile for the child’s age) x (Height (m))^2
**LBM** (kg) = 3.8 x ECV Extracellular Volume (ECV) in litres = (0.0215) x (weight)^0.65 x (height)^0.72

## Anaesthetic considerations
- Preoperative review to detect comorbidities and anticipate postoperative care requirements.
    
- If sedative premedication is given, dose appropriately and monitor oxygen saturations.
    
- Ensure adequately sized blood pressure cuff available.
    
- Ensure ultrasound availability for cannulation.
    
- Care with handling and positioning, use appropriate patient transfer equipment.
    
- Ensure optimal head up position for induction, adequately pre-oxygenate using PEEP, anticipate laryngoscopy and ventilation difficulties.
    
- Use regional anaesthetic techniques and multimodal analgesia to reduce opioid use.
    
- Monitor neuromuscular blockade and depth of anaesthesia.
    
- Extubate awake and sitting up.
    
- Monitor oxygen saturation continuously and give supplemental oxygen if required.
    
- Early mobilization and physiotherapy to reduce risk of respiratory complications and VTE.
